 * The {@code CommandProcessor} class orchestrates the handling of player input by 
 * coordinating parsing, validation, and execution of commands in the game. 
 * <p>
 * It follows a three-step process:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Parse the raw input into a structured {@link ParsedCommand}.</li>
 *   <li>Validate the parsed command against the game state and player state.</li>
 *   <li>Execute the validated command to produce an {@link ActionResult}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This class also logs key steps of command processing for debugging and monitoring.
