Room no 1:
Shadows stretch across the tangled underbrush, where thick vines and twisted roots create a near-impenetrable barrier. The air is dense and damp, filled with the earthy scent of moss and decay. Occasional patches of faint light pierce through the dense canopy above, but visibility is limited, adding an eerie silence as if the forest itself is holding its breath. This secluded area feels untouched, as though few, if any, have dared to venture this far.

Room No 2:
Thick, warped trees loom overhead, their branches twisted into unnatural shapes as if mutated by some unseen force. The forest floor is littered with strange, luminous fungi that cast an eerie glow, illuminating grotesque vines that snake along the ground. A pungent odor fills the air, sharp and sour, hinting at the unnatural lifeforms that thrive here. Every sound seems distorted, as if the forest itself is alive and watching from the shadows.
