Map Screen
Buttons for shelter
Buttons for load game and remove the list. Bottom button will recycle through next lot if any
Commands above are buttons that if you click them, the command is repeated
End game buttons - play again?

Changes to be noted
Need to have a look/search command to offer clues (examine room?)
	- There is a weight functionality, and code where the player will randomly drop items, however no way for it
	  to be called - will change that and check it out - also look at the original code (there is a section where
	  if strength is less than 50 it drops one of the first 9 items) - update will reduce the player's strength
	  based on the number of items carried (the weight) but I need to check out the 9 items problem.
	- Thing about the torch - wave it to allow pass arms - no way to know how to do it - also can drop the torch
	  and it still allows it - though will need to check that in the code - response when the torch is bright in
	  the arms room.
	- The apple is in the same room as the snake, but there is no indication that it is there, and no hints.
	  Giving the apple to the snake removes it. I need to consider the apple - probably add something to the title
	- Chest - change the name when opened. Indicate the note in the chest as well.
	- Well, actually, turns out that there are lots of hints in the book, so yeah, I might just refer to player there
	- choping a thing doesn't returns to the command line as opposed to ending the game - need to look into that
	- There is something about the mouth-like opening in the stone - do we know it is there.
		- Actually, maybe start by rubbing the stone to reveal the mounth, and then rub mouth (with rag)
	- logmen seem to be going to odd places (the cave & forest). Need to confirm where they need to go.
	- Rag needs to be displayed in hut
	- Should only get wisdom bonus for taking an object once - each object has a wisdom flag - if checked do not get bonus. If not checked get bonus and flag checked
	- need to check what to do with the lillies - then disappearing when you attack the sage is rather odd.
	- Have lilly special flag if attack the sage so the lillies disappearing do not cross with ancient sage
	- Odd that two entrances to Abode Hut
	- Torch does not appear to be displayed at Entrance - should be mentioned - special response when take it first, and then afterwards
	- What is the purpose of the Here!!! room, and also where is the vision room?
	- Better description for the swampman taking the jug?
	- When filling the jug with water (where the spring is) have reference to it being unable to hold water.
	- Also, like, have where you can go into places (like go hut at Grandpa's hut).
	- Where there is only a 'special' exit - don't display also.
	- Dessicated villager - can only give drink once - should change name
	- Reason why suffer damage in the clone room - should say something
