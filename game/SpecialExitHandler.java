/**
 * Handles special exits for certain rooms in the adventure game.
 * <p>
 * Unlike normal exits, which are handled in a generic way, some rooms
 * have unique exits or additional descriptions that require custom logic.
 * This class manages those cases, ensuring the player receives the correct
 * directional and descriptive information when navigating.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each special exit is stored in a {@link Map}, keyed by the room number
 * (from {@link GameEntities}). The value is a two-element {@code String[]},
 * where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Index 0 → The direction to suppress (the normal exit should not display).</li>
 *   <li>Index 1 → The description to display for the special exit.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example:  
 * {@code {WEST, "You can also go west into the cave"}}  
 * suppresses the default west exit, and instead provides a custom description.
 * </p>
 * 
 * This class is {@link Serializable} for compatibility with saved game states.
