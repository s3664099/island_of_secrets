Rub - This is used to stop the stones from preventing you from moving
	- Need to work out how to get here and then to the stones to test it works.
	- So, rub opening with the rag and the flags are set (and you hear the word as well).
Wave - Wave the torch and then use it to pass the hands (though you should be holding the torch as well - maybe reset the flag if dropped)
	- Rooms with arms (28) and torch (item 7) flag != 1 - So, after this the player should be able to move

  Considering adding a command to examine (and adding it without having to make any significant changes to the code - will probably have
  to tack it onto the end and increase the number of verbs).

	- Check how to allow swampman to let you move and test that
	- Works - When tells his tale the flag is set to -1, which means he will block your way east.
		- If you are in the room and the flag is 0, then he tells his tale.
