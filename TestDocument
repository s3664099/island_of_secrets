To Test
Move Command

	





	
	

	
Give - Give the shiny apple to the snake and it moves and allows entry to the hut	
Rub - This is used to stop the stones from preventing you from moving
	- Need to work out how to get here and then to the stones to test it works.
	- So, rub opening with the rag and the flags are set (and you hear the word as well).
Ride - Need Canyon Beast, and can only take beast if have the rope.
	- When have the rope, the beast will allow you to ride it, and will set the beast flag to -1
	  Which allows you to climb the path.
	- If have canyon beast and on log pier (33) - runs away to random place (1-4)
Wave - Wave the torch and then use it to pass the hands (though you should be holding the torch as well - maybe reset the flag if dropped)
	- Rooms with arms (28) and torch (item 7) flag != 1 - So, after this the player should be able to move

- Down 51 when Trap Door flag = 0 goes to poisoned water - You have to be in the room and type 'open trapdoor' for this to activate
  Considering adding a command to examine (and adding it without having to make any significant changes to the code - will probably have
  to tack it onto the end and increase the number of verbs).
 - Omegan is in player location, strength+wisdom<180 or room=10 - cannot leave (and displays)
 - Player in room with Swampman, tries to go east, and swampman flag<1 - can't move (otherwise can)
	- Check how to allow swampman to let you move and test that
	- Works - When tells his tale the flag is set to -1, which means he will block your way east.
		- If you are in the room and the flag is 0, then he tells his tale.
- Check can move & can't - I know this works.
- The Ferry Man - Go Boat - works
	- Have to be in same room as boatman and type 'go boat'
	- If less than 60 - go to serve Omegan forever
	- If greater, goes to Island of Secrets
