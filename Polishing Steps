TRAPDOOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Operator Precedence Bug ⚠️

return (command.getCodedCommand().equals(GameEntities.CODE_DOWN_TRAPDOOR) ||
        command.getCodedCommand().equals(GameEntities.CODE_ENTER_TRAPDOOR) &&
        (game.getItem(GameEntities.ITEM_TRAPDOOR).getItemFlag()==1));


Because && binds more tightly than ||, this is evaluated as:

(CODE_DOWN_TRAPDOOR) || (CODE_ENTER_TRAPDOOR && trapdoorClosed)


which is not what you intend. You want parentheses around the ||:

return (command.getCodedCommand().equals(GameEntities.CODE_DOWN_TRAPDOOR) ||
        command.getCodedCommand().equals(GameEntities.CODE_ENTER_TRAPDOOR)) &&
        game.getItem(GameEntities.ITEM_TRAPDOOR).getItemFlag() == 1;


Same issue in checkGoTrapdoorOpen.
