# Island of Secrets

This project is a modern translation of the game *Island of Secrets*, originally published as a BASIC listing in a book of the same name. Players would type the game into their computers to play it. However, the authors intentionally obfuscated the code to make it difficult for users to deduce the game’s solution, while still leaving the game playable. 

This approach came with challenges: errors often crept in during transcription, and the lack of comments or documentation made it hard for users to learn the tricks of the BASIC language. The code’s readability was also notoriously poor, adding to the difficulty.

## Notes on the Basic Code

### Reading the Data
Unlike many other games, this program doesn't load all data into memory at once, likely due to memory constraints of early computers. Instead, it reads one item at a time, which slows down the game as data must be read repeatedly.  

- **Line 2780**: Repositions the pointer to the beginning of the data and iterates through all locations, discarding each one.  
- **Line 4110**: Iterates through and discards all objects.

Object locations are stored in a string `H$`, where ASCII symbols represent specific locations. The next line uses the string `Q$` as a flag for each object, influencing gameplay throughout.

The game operates on a 10x10 grid, with movement between nodes determined by:
- Adding or subtracting **1** (east or west movement)
- Adding or subtracting **10** (north or south movement)

### Documentation
A supplementary file contains detailed notes on:
- The BASIC code sections and their functions
- Variables, items, locations, verbs, and nouns

## Executing the Game

## Program Structure ##

### Default Package

This package is only used to start the game, and only holds the class that launches the game.

## **Start**  

### **Overview**  
The `Start` class serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the game and starts execution by invoking the main game logic.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Initializes the `Main` game object.  
2. Calls the `startGame()` method to begin the game.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`Start()`**  
  - The class does not define an explicit constructor since it only contains the `main` method.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`main(String[] args)`**  
   - Entry point of the application.  
   - Creates an instance of `Main` and starts the game by calling `startGame()`.

---

### Controller Package

The controller package is a part of the MVP pattern and holds all of the classes that execute the commands. This does not process the commands but are rather classes that are tied to buttons or text input boxes, and basically retrieve the action and interpretates it, and then sends it to the specific model class.

## **BookButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `BookButton` class is responsible for handling button actions that open an external webpage and update the game's display.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Opens a specified webpage in the user's default web browser.  
2. Updates the game display state.  
3. Changes the current game panel to a new one.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`BookButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`**  
  - Initializes the `game` and `panel` objects.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Checks if the system supports the `Desktop` class.  
   - Attempts to open a specific webpage (`https://archive.org/details/island-of-secrets_202303`) in the default web browser.  
   - Updates the game display state.  
   - Changes the game panel to a new one.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of user feedback:** If an error occurs while opening the URL, the exception is only printed to the console. A user-friendly error message could be displayed instead.  
- **Platform dependency:** `Desktop.getDesktop()` is not supported on all platforms, especially in some Linux environments. Consider handling this case more gracefully.  
- **Hardcoded URL:** The URL is hardcoded, which reduces flexibility. It could be moved to a configuration file or passed as a parameter for easier modification.

---

## **CommandButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `CommandButton` class handles button actions that trigger a specific in-game command.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Stores a predefined command string.  
2. Processes the command when the button is clicked.  
3. Passes the game panel to the command processor.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`CommandButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, String command)`**  
  - Initializes the game engine, game panel, and the command string.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `game.processCommand(command, panel)`, triggering the command when the button is clicked.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of command validation:** The command is passed directly to `processCommand()`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if it is invalid. Consider adding validation.  
- **Hardcoded command:** Since the command is set at instantiation, this button cannot change its behavior dynamically. A more flexible approach might involve user input or a mapping system.  
- **Potential for null values:** If the `command` string is `null`, it might cause errors in `processCommand()`. Consider adding a null check before execution.

---

## **CommandListener**  

### **Overview**  
The `CommandListener` class listens for keyboard input in a text field and processes the entered command when the Enter key is pressed.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Captures user input from a `JTextField`.  
2. Detects when the Enter key is pressed.  
3. Sends the command to the game engine for processing based on the game’s response type.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`CommandListener(JTextField text, GameEngine game, GamePanel gameFrame)`**  
  - Initializes the text field, game engine, and game panel.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`keyPressed(KeyEvent evt)`**  
   - Checks if the Enter key is pressed.  
   - Retrieves and clears the text field input.  
   - Calls the appropriate game processing method based on `game.getResponseType()`.  
2. **`keyReleased(KeyEvent arg0)`**  
   - Required by `KeyListener`, but not implemented.  
3. **`keyTyped(KeyEvent arg0)`**  
   - Required by `KeyListener`, but not implemented.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **No validation on user input:** If the text field is empty, the command is still sent. Consider handling empty input.  
- **Tightly coupled to response types:** The logic for selecting the processing method is hardcoded. A more flexible approach might use a strategy pattern or command mapping.  
- **Hardcoded Enter key detection:** If different keybindings are needed in the future, consider allowing configurable key mappings.

---

## **GameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `GameButton` class handles button click events to switch the game display and update the game panel.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle button press events.  
2. Hide the current game display.  
3. Update the game panel with a new panel instance.  

### **Constructor**  
- `GameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`: Initializes the button with the game engine and the new game panel.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Called when the button is clicked.  
   - Hides the current game display and sets the new game panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of UI feedback:** The class updates the panel but does not provide any visual confirmation to the user. Consider adding animations or messages.  
- **Limited functionality:** If additional behavior is needed (e.g., verifying conditions before switching the panel), this should be handled within `actionPerformed()`.  
- **Hardcoded behavior:** Always sets the game display to `false`. If future functionality requires toggling or conditional behavior, modifications may be needed.

---

## **LoadGameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `LoadGameButton` class handles button click events to load a saved game by executing a load command.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle button press events.  
2. Extract the game name from the provided filename.  
3. Trigger the game's load functionality using the processed command.  

### **Constructor**  
- `LoadGameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, String gameName)`:  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, panel, and game name.  
  - Strips the last four characters from `gameName` to remove a file extension.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Executes the `"load <gameName>"` command through the game engine when the button is clicked.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **String Manipulation Assumption:** The constructor removes the last four characters from `gameName`, assuming all game files have a four-character extension (e.g., `.sav`). If this assumption is incorrect, it may produce unexpected behavior.  
- **Hardcoded Command Format:** Always executes `"load <gameName>"`, which may not be flexible enough if different loading mechanisms are required in the future.  
- **No Error Handling:** If the game name is too short (fewer than four characters), an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` could occur. Adding validation would improve robustness.  
- **Lack of UI Feedback:** No confirmation message is displayed to indicate whether the game was successfully loaded. Consider adding a message or visual indicator.

---

## **MapButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `MapButton` class handles user interaction with a button designed to display the map panel in the game interface.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Detect button clicks.  
2. Update the game engine to display the map panel.  

### **Constructor**  
- `MapButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`:  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine and the panel that represents the map.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `setMapPanel(this.panel)` on the game engine to switch the display to the map panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Assumes Panel is a Map Panel:** The constructor accepts any `GamePanel` without verifying if it actually represents a map. If the wrong panel is passed, unexpected behavior may occur.  
- **Lack of Confirmation or Feedback:** The method changes the panel but does not provide any confirmation to the user. Consider adding a visual indicator or a log message.  
- **No Null Checks:** If `panel` or `game` is `null`, the program may crash. Adding a null check would improve robustness.  
- **Limited Functionality:** This button only switches to the map panel. If additional actions (such as refreshing the map) are needed, the method might need to be extended.

---

## **QuitButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `QuitButton` class handles user interaction with a button designed to either close the game or restart it, depending on the provided configuration.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Close the game window if restarting is not required.  
2. Restart the game with a new game instance if the restart flag is `true`.  
3. Update the game panel after restarting the game.  

### **Constructor**  
- `QuitButton(GameFrame frame, boolean restart, GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game frame, a flag to determine whether to restart the game, the game engine, and a panel to display after restarting.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - If `restart` is `false`, disposes of the game window.  
   - If `restart` is `true`, resets the game by creating a new `Game` and `Player` instance, then updates the panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Game Restart Logic Might Not Preserve Progress**: The restart process initializes a new `Game` and `Player` without saving any previous state. If saving game progress is needed, additional logic should be implemented.  
- **No Confirmation Before Closing**: The game window closes immediately without asking the user for confirmation. Consider adding a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental closures.  
- **Hardcoded `new Game()` and `new Player()`**: If a different method of resetting the game is needed in the future (e.g., loading a saved state), this approach may need modification.  
- **Potential `null` Issues**: If `game` or `panel` is `null`, calling methods on them could cause a `NullPointerException`. Adding null checks would improve robustness.

## **SearchGameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `SearchGameButton` class allows users to navigate through a list of available game saves, either moving to the next or previous entry.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle user interaction with a button for navigating game saves.  
2. Increase the game load index when moving to the next save.  
3. Decrease the game load index when moving to the previous save.  

### **Constructor**  
- `SearchGameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, boolean next)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, game panel, and a boolean flag indicating whether to move forward (`true`) or backward (`false`).  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `increaseLoad(panel)` if `next` is `true`, moving forward in the save list.  
   - Calls `decreaseLoad(panel)` if `next` is `false`, moving backward in the save list.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **No Bounds Checking on Load Index**: If `increaseLoad` or `decreaseLoad` is called without validation, it may attempt to navigate past the first or last available save. Consider adding checks to prevent out-of-bounds errors.  
- **Button Behavior Not Explicitly Defined**: It is unclear what happens when no saves exist. Implementing proper UI feedback (e.g., disabling the button) would improve usability.  
- **Panel May Not Need to Be Passed**: If `panel` is only used for updating the display, consider handling UI updates within `increaseLoad` and `decreaseLoad` instead of passing `panel` as a parameter.

---

## **ShelterButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `ShelterButton` class handles user interaction for moving the player to a specific location,  representing a shelter or safe area in the game.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Update the player's current location in the game.  
2. Reset the game's response type to `0`, ensuring normal gameplay interaction.  
3. Update the game panel to reflect the new state.  

### **Constructor**  
- `ShelterButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, int location)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, game panel, and the target location to move the player.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Resets the game's response type to `0`.  
   - Updates the player's current room to the specified location.  
   - Sets the game panel to update the UI.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of Validation on Location**: If `location` is invalid (e.g., out of bounds or null), it could cause unexpected behavior. Consider adding validation.  
- **No Confirmation for Movement**: If the move is irreversible or important, a confirmation dialog could prevent accidental clicks.  
- **Panel Update Assumes Immediate Transition**: If additional game logic is needed (e.g., animations or events triggering), consider handling this within `setGamePanel()`.

### Data Package

## **Constants**

### **Overview**
The `Constants` class is a utility class that defines a set of **public static final** constants. These constants are used to store fixed values that are shared across the application, such as configuration values, limits, or identifiers. The class does not have any behavior (methods) or state (instance variables) and is intended to be used as a centralized place for constant values.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Storing Game Configuration**: Holds constants related to the game's structure, such as the number of rooms, items, verbs, and nouns.
2. **Defining Item Limits**: Stores thresholds or identifiers for specific item types (e.g., `foodLine` and `drinkLine`).
3. **Providing UI Utilities**: Includes a string (`line`) and its length (`lineLength`) for use as a visual separator or divider in the UI.

### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. Since all fields are `static`, there is no need to instantiate the class. It is intended to be used as a static utility class.

### **Methods**
The class does not define any methods. It only contains static fields.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Non-Final `line` Field**
- **Flaw**: The `line` field is not declared as `final`, which means it can be modified at runtime. This contradicts the purpose of a constants class, where all fields should be immutable.
- **Change**: Declare `line` as `final` to ensure immutability:
  ```java
  public static final String line = "----------------------------------------------------------------";
  ```

#### **2. Hardcoded `line` String**
- **Flaw**: The `line` string is hardcoded, which makes it less flexible. If `lineLength` changes, the `line` string will not automatically reflect the new length.
- **Change**: Generate the `line` string dynamically based on `lineLength`:
  ```java
  public static final String line = "-".repeat(lineLength);
  ```

#### **3. Lack of Grouping for Related Constants**
- **Flaw**: Constants like `foodLine` and `drinkLine` are related but are not grouped together. This can make the class harder to navigate and understand.
- **Change**: Group related constants in a nested class or use an `enum` for better organization:
  ```java
  public static final class ItemLimits {
      public static final int FOOD = 16;
      public static final int DRINK = 21;
  }
  ```

#### **4. Non-Descriptive Field Names**
- **Flaw**: Some field names (e.g., `noRooms`, `noItems`) are not very descriptive and could be improved for better readability.
- **Change**: Use more descriptive names:
  ```java
  public static final int NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 80;
  public static final int NUMBER_OF_ITEMS = 43;
  ```

#### **5. No Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: All fields are `public`, which exposes them to direct modification (if not `final`) and reduces encapsulation.
- **Change**: While constants are typically `public`, consider using a private constructor to prevent instantiation of the class:
  ```java
  private Constants() {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class");
  }
  ```

#### **6. Potential for Overloading**
- **Flaw**: The class could become bloated if too many unrelated constants are added in the future.
- **Change**: Split the class into multiple smaller classes or enums based on the context of the constants (e.g., `GameConstants`, `UIConstants`).

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s how the class could look after applying the suggested changes:

```java
public final class Constants {

    // Prevent instantiation
    private Constants() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class");
    }

    // Game-related constants
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 80;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_ITEMS = 43;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_VERBS = 42;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_NOUNS = 52;
    public static final int CARRIABLE_ITEMS = 24;

    // Item type limits
    public static final class ItemLimits {
        public static final int FOOD = 16;
        public static final int DRINK = 21;
    }

    // UI-related constants
    public static final int SEPARATOR_LINE_LENGTH = 90;
    public static final String SEPARATOR_LINE = "-".repeat(SEPARATOR_LINE_LENGTH);
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. Made `line` final and dynamically generated it.
2. Grouped related constants (`foodLine` and `drinkLine`) into a nested class.
3. Improved field names for better readability.
4. Added a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
5. Ensured all fields are `final` for immutability.

Here’s the analysis of your `Item` class using the provided template:

---

## **Item**

### **Overview**
The `Item` class represents an item in the game. It stores information about the item, such as its description, location, and flags, and provides methods to manipulate and query this information. The class implements the `Serializable` interface, allowing instances of `Item` to be serialized and deserialized.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Storing Item Information**: Holds data about the item, including its description, location, and flags.
2. **Validating Item Location**: Provides a method to check if the item is present at a specific location.
3. **Manipulating Item State**: Allows modification of the item's location, flag, description, and wisdom-gained status.
4. **Serialization Support**: Implements `Serializable` to enable object serialization.

### **Constructor**
- **`Item(char flag, char location, String item)`**
  - Initializes an `Item` object with the provided `flag`, `location`, and `description`.
  - Converts the `flag` and `location` characters to integers using specific logic:
    - `flag` is converted by subtracting `48` (ASCII value of `'0'`).
    - `location` is converted by subtracting `32` (ASCII value of space). If the result is greater than `127`, it is further adjusted by subtracting `96`.
  - Saves the item description.

### **Methods**
1. **`getItem()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's description.
   - **Usage**: Used to retrieve the textual representation of the item.

2. **`checkLocation(int location)`**
   - **Description**: Checks if the item is present at the specified location.
   - **Usage**: Used to determine if the item is located at a given place in the game.

3. **`getFlag()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's flag.
   - **Usage**: Retrieves the flag associated with the item.

4. **`getLocation()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's current location.
   - **Usage**: Retrieves the location of the item.

5. **`setLocation(int newLocation)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's location.
   - **Usage**: Used to move the item to a new location.

6. **`setFlag(int flag)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's flag.
   - **Usage**: Modifies the flag associated with the item.

7. **`setDescription(String description)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's description.
   - **Usage**: Changes the textual representation of the item.

8. **`setWisdomGain()`**
   - **Description**: Toggles the `wisdomGained` status of the item.
   - **Usage**: Used to indicate whether wisdom has been gained from the item.

9. **`checkWisdomGain()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the current state of `wisdomGained`.
   - **Usage**: Checks if wisdom has been gained from the item.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers in Constructor**
- **Flaw**: The constructor uses magic numbers (`48`, `32`, `127`, `96`) for character-to-integer conversion. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or provide comments explaining their purpose:
  ```java
  private static final int FLAG_OFFSET = 48; // ASCII value of '0'
  private static final int LOCATION_OFFSET = 32; // ASCII value of space
  private static final int LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT = 96; // Adjustment for values > 127
  ```

#### **2. Lack of Validation**
- **Flaw**: The constructor and setter methods do not validate input values (e.g., negative locations or invalid flags).
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure values are within expected ranges:
  ```java
  if (location < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Location cannot be negative");
  }
  ```

#### **3. Inconsistent Naming**
- **Flaw**: The field `item` and method `getItem()` use inconsistent naming. The field should be renamed to `description` for clarity.
- **Change**: Rename the field and update the method:
  ```java
  private String description;
  public String getDescription() {
      return this.description;
  }
  ```

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- **Flaw**: The `itemFlag` and `itemLocation` fields are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after object creation. This reduces the predictability of the class.
- **Change**: If these fields should not change after initialization, make them `final` and remove the setter methods.

#### **5. Serialization Risks**
- **Flaw**: The class implements `Serializable` but does not handle potential serialization issues (e.g., changes to the class structure over time).
- **Change**: Ensure the `serialVersionUID` is updated if the class structure changes significantly. Consider adding custom serialization logic if needed.

#### **6. Boolean Toggle Logic**
- **Flaw**: The `setWisdomGain()` method toggles the `wisdomGained` field, which might be unintuitive for users of the class.
- **Change**: Replace the toggle method with explicit `setWisdomGain(boolean)`:
  ```java
  public void setWisdomGain(boolean wisdomGained) {
      this.wisdomGained = wisdomGained;
  }
  ```

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s how the class could look after applying the suggested changes:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Item implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -2697850646469797958L;

    // Constants for character-to-integer conversion
    private static final int FLAG_OFFSET = 48; // ASCII value of '0'
    private static final int LOCATION_OFFSET = 32; // ASCII value of space
    private static final int LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT = 96; // Adjustment for values > 127

    private int itemFlag;
    private int itemLocation;
    private String description;
    private boolean wisdomGained = false;

    public Item(char flag, char location, String description) {
        // Convert characters to integers
        this.itemFlag = (int) flag - FLAG_OFFSET;
        this.itemLocation = (int) location - LOCATION_OFFSET;

        if (this.itemLocation > 127) {
            this.itemLocation -= LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT;
        }

        // Validate input
        if (this.itemLocation < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid location value");
        }

        // Save description
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return this.description;
    }

    public boolean checkLocation(int location) {
        return location == this.itemLocation;
    }

    public int getFlag() {
        return this.itemFlag;
    }

    public int getLocation() {
        return this.itemLocation;
    }

    public void setLocation(int newLocation) {
        if (newLocation < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Location cannot be negative");
        }
        this.itemLocation = newLocation;
    }

    public void setFlag(int flag) {
        this.itemFlag = flag;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public void setWisdomGain(boolean wisdomGained) {
        this.wisdomGained = wisdomGained;
    }

    public boolean checkWisdomGain() {
        return this.wisdomGained;
    }
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. Replaced magic numbers with named constants.
2. Added input validation in the constructor and setter methods.
3. Renamed the `item` field to `description` for clarity.
4. Improved the `setWisdomGain()` method to accept a boolean parameter.
5. Added comments to explain the purpose of constants and logic.

## **Location**

### **Overview**

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Stores information about a location, including its name, exits, visitation status, and type.
2. Parses the location name to determine available exits.
3. Tracks whether the location has been visited or viewed.
4. Supports serialization for saving and loading game states.

### **Constructor**
- **`Location(String name, String[] prepositions, String roomType)`**
  - Initializes a `Location` object with the provided `name`, `prepositions`, and `roomType`.
  - Parses the `name` string to extract the preposition and determine the available exits.
  - The `name` string is expected to have a specific format:
    - The first character represents an index into the `prepositions` array.
    - The last four characters represent the exits (e.g., `"0"` for an open exit, other values for closed exits).
  - Sets the `roomType` and initializes the `exits` array based on the parsed data.

### **Methods**
1. **`getName()`**
   - Returns the formatted name of the location.

2. **`getExits()`**
   - Returns an array of booleans representing the available exits.

3. **`setVisited()`**
   - Marks the location as visited.

4. **`getVisited()`**
   - Returns whether the location has been visited.

5. **`setViewed()`**
   - Marks the location as viewed.

6. **`getViewed()`**
   - Returns whether the location has been viewed.

7. **`getRoomType()`**
   - Returns the type of the room.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers and String Manipulation**
- The constructor uses hardcoded indices (`0`, `1`, `name.length()-4`) for string manipulation, which makes the code less readable and maintainable.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants:
  ```java
  private static final int PREPOSITION_INDEX = 0;
  private static final int EXIT_START_INDEX = name.length() - 4;
  ```

#### **2. Lack of Input Validation**
- The constructor does not validate the input parameters (e.g., `name`, `prepositions`, `roomType`). Invalid input could lead to runtime errors.
- **Change**: Add validation:
  ```java
  if (name == null || name.length() < 5) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid name format");
  }
  if (prepositions == null || prepositions.length == 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Prepositions array cannot be null or empty");
  }
  ```

#### **3. Inefficient String Parsing**
- The constructor uses `substring` multiple times to parse the `name` string, which can be inefficient.
- **Change**: Use a single `substring` call:
  ```java
  String exitString = name.substring(name.length() - 4);
  ```

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- The `name` and `roomType` fields are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after object creation.
- **Change**: Make them `final` if they should not change after initialization.

#### **5. Boolean Array for Exits**
- The `exits` array uses a boolean to represent each exit, which limits flexibility (e.g., cannot represent different types of exits).
- **Change**: Use an `enum` to represent exit types:
  ```java
  public enum ExitType {
      OPEN,
      CLOSED,
      LOCKED
  }
  private ExitType[] exits = new ExitType[4];
  ```

### **Improved Version of the Class**
```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Location implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 7421397108414613755L;

    private static final int PREPOSITION_INDEX = 0;
    private static final int EXIT_START_INDEX = 4;

    private final String name;
    private final boolean[] exits = new boolean[4];
    private boolean visited = false;
    private boolean viewed = false;
    private final String roomType;

    public Location(String name, String[] prepositions, String roomType) {
        if (name == null || name.length() < 5) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid name format");
        }
        if (prepositions == null || prepositions.length == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Prepositions array cannot be null or empty");
        }

        int prepIndex = Integer.parseInt(name.substring(PREPOSITION_INDEX, PREPOSITION_INDEX + 1)) - 1;
        this.name = String.format("%s %s", prepositions[prepIndex], name.substring(1, name.length() - EXIT_START_INDEX));
        this.roomType = roomType;

        String exitString = name.substring(name.length() - EXIT_START_INDEX);
        for (int i = 0; i < exits.length; i++) {
            exits[i] = exitString.charAt(i) == '0';
        }
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public boolean[] getExits() {
        return this.exits.clone();
    }

    public void setVisited() {
        this.visited = true;
    }

    public boolean getVisited() {
        return this.visited;
    }

    public void setViewed() {
        this.viewed = true;
    }

    public boolean getViewed() {
        return this.viewed;
    }

    public String getRoomType() {
        return this.roomType;
    }
}

## **RawData**

### **Overview**

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Stores static data for locations, objects, verbs, nouns, and prepositions.
2. Provides methods to retrieve specific data based on indices or other criteria.
3. Acts as a centralized repository for game-related constants and configurations.


### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. It is a utility class with only static fields and methods.


### **Methods**
1. **`getLocation(int number)`**
   - Returns the location string at the specified index from the `locations` array.

2. **`getImage(int number)`**
   - Returns the image string associated with the location type at the specified index.

3. **`getObjects(int number)`**
   - Returns the object string at the specified index from the `objects` array.

4. **`getPrepositions()`**
   - Returns the array of prepositions.

5. **`getItemLocation(int number)`**
   - Returns the character at the specified index from the `itemLocation` string.

6. **`getItemFlag(int number)`**
   - Returns the character at the specified index from the `itemFlag` string.

7. **`getVerbs()`**
   - Returns the array of verbs.

8. **`getNouns()`**
   - Returns the array of nouns.


### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Data**
- The class contains hardcoded data (e.g., `locationTypes`, `locations`, `objects`), which makes it inflexible and harder to maintain.
- **Change**: Consider loading this data from an external file (e.g., JSON, XML) to make it easier to update and manage.

#### **2. Lack of Encapsulation**
- All fields are `static` and `public`, which exposes them to direct modification and reduces encapsulation.
- **Change**: Make fields `private` and provide static getter methods for access.

#### **3. Inefficient Data Retrieval**
- The `getImage` method uses `locationTypes[number-1]` to index into `locationImage`, which could lead to confusion or errors if `number` is out of bounds.
- **Change**: Add bounds checking to prevent `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- Some fields (e.g., `itemLocation`, `itemFlag`) are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after initialization.
- **Change**: Make these fields `final` to ensure immutability.

#### **5. Poor Readability**
- The `locations` and `objects` arrays contain long strings with no comments or explanations, making it hard to understand their structure.
- **Change**: Add comments or split the data into smaller, more manageable chunks.

#### **6. No Input Validation**
- Methods like `getLocation`, `getImage`, and `getObjects` do not validate the input `number`, which could lead to runtime errors.
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure the input is within the valid range.
