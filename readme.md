# Island of Secrets

This project is a modern translation of the game *Island of Secrets*, originally published as a BASIC listing in a book of the same name. Players would type the game into their computers to play it. However, the authors intentionally obfuscated the code to make it difficult for users to deduce the game’s solution, while still leaving the game playable. 

This approach came with challenges: errors often crept in during transcription, and the lack of comments or documentation made it hard for users to learn the tricks of the BASIC language. The code’s readability was also notoriously poor, adding to the difficulty.

## Notes on the Basic Code

### Reading the Data
Unlike many other games, this program doesn't load all data into memory at once, likely due to memory constraints of early computers. Instead, it reads one item at a time, which slows down the game as data must be read repeatedly.  

- **Line 2780**: Repositions the pointer to the beginning of the data and iterates through all locations, discarding each one.  
- **Line 4110**: Iterates through and discards all objects.

Object locations are stored in a string `H$`, where ASCII symbols represent specific locations. The next line uses the string `Q$` as a flag for each object, influencing gameplay throughout.

The game operates on a 10x10 grid, with movement between nodes determined by:
- Adding or subtracting **1** (east or west movement)
- Adding or subtracting **10** (north or south movement)

### Documentation
A supplementary file contains detailed notes on:
- The BASIC code sections and their functions
- Variables, items, locations, verbs, and nouns

## Executing the Game

## Program Structure ##

### Default Package

This package is only used to start the game, and only holds the class that launches the game.

## **Start**  

### **Overview**  
The `Start` class serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the game and starts execution by invoking the main game logic.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Initializes the `Main` game object.  
2. Calls the `startGame()` method to begin the game.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`Start()`**  
  - The class does not define an explicit constructor since it only contains the `main` method.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`main(String[] args)`**  
   - Entry point of the application.  
   - Creates an instance of `Main` and starts the game by calling `startGame()`.

---

### Controller Package

The controller package is a part of the MVP pattern and holds all of the classes that execute the commands. This does not process the commands but are rather classes that are tied to buttons or text input boxes, and basically retrieve the action and interpretates it, and then sends it to the specific model class.

## **BookButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `BookButton` class is responsible for handling button actions that open an external webpage and update the game's display.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Opens a specified webpage in the user's default web browser.  
2. Updates the game display state.  
3. Changes the current game panel to a new one.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`BookButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`**  
  - Initializes the `game` and `panel` objects.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Checks if the system supports the `Desktop` class.  
   - Attempts to open a specific webpage (`https://archive.org/details/island-of-secrets_202303`) in the default web browser.  
   - Updates the game display state.  
   - Changes the game panel to a new one.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of user feedback:** If an error occurs while opening the URL, the exception is only printed to the console. A user-friendly error message could be displayed instead.  
- **Platform dependency:** `Desktop.getDesktop()` is not supported on all platforms, especially in some Linux environments. Consider handling this case more gracefully.  
- **Hardcoded URL:** The URL is hardcoded, which reduces flexibility. It could be moved to a configuration file or passed as a parameter for easier modification.

---

## **CommandButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `CommandButton` class handles button actions that trigger a specific in-game command.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Stores a predefined command string.  
2. Processes the command when the button is clicked.  
3. Passes the game panel to the command processor.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`CommandButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, String command)`**  
  - Initializes the game engine, game panel, and the command string.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `game.processCommand(command, panel)`, triggering the command when the button is clicked.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of command validation:** The command is passed directly to `processCommand()`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if it is invalid. Consider adding validation.  
- **Hardcoded command:** Since the command is set at instantiation, this button cannot change its behavior dynamically. A more flexible approach might involve user input or a mapping system.  
- **Potential for null values:** If the `command` string is `null`, it might cause errors in `processCommand()`. Consider adding a null check before execution.

---

## **CommandListener**  

### **Overview**  
The `CommandListener` class listens for keyboard input in a text field and processes the entered command when the Enter key is pressed.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Captures user input from a `JTextField`.  
2. Detects when the Enter key is pressed.  
3. Sends the command to the game engine for processing based on the game’s response type.  

### **Constructor**  
- **`CommandListener(JTextField text, GameEngine game, GamePanel gameFrame)`**  
  - Initializes the text field, game engine, and game panel.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`keyPressed(KeyEvent evt)`**  
   - Checks if the Enter key is pressed.  
   - Retrieves and clears the text field input.  
   - Calls the appropriate game processing method based on `game.getResponseType()`.  
2. **`keyReleased(KeyEvent arg0)`**  
   - Required by `KeyListener`, but not implemented.  
3. **`keyTyped(KeyEvent arg0)`**  
   - Required by `KeyListener`, but not implemented.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **No validation on user input:** If the text field is empty, the command is still sent. Consider handling empty input.  
- **Tightly coupled to response types:** The logic for selecting the processing method is hardcoded. A more flexible approach might use a strategy pattern or command mapping.  
- **Hardcoded Enter key detection:** If different keybindings are needed in the future, consider allowing configurable key mappings.

---

## **GameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `GameButton` class handles button click events to switch the game display and update the game panel.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle button press events.  
2. Hide the current game display.  
3. Update the game panel with a new panel instance.  

### **Constructor**  
- `GameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`: Initializes the button with the game engine and the new game panel.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Called when the button is clicked.  
   - Hides the current game display and sets the new game panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of UI feedback:** The class updates the panel but does not provide any visual confirmation to the user. Consider adding animations or messages.  
- **Limited functionality:** If additional behavior is needed (e.g., verifying conditions before switching the panel), this should be handled within `actionPerformed()`.  
- **Hardcoded behavior:** Always sets the game display to `false`. If future functionality requires toggling or conditional behavior, modifications may be needed.

---

## **LoadGameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `LoadGameButton` class handles button click events to load a saved game by executing a load command.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle button press events.  
2. Extract the game name from the provided filename.  
3. Trigger the game's load functionality using the processed command.  

### **Constructor**  
- `LoadGameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, String gameName)`:  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, panel, and game name.  
  - Strips the last four characters from `gameName` to remove a file extension.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Executes the `"load <gameName>"` command through the game engine when the button is clicked.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **String Manipulation Assumption:** The constructor removes the last four characters from `gameName`, assuming all game files have a four-character extension (e.g., `.sav`). If this assumption is incorrect, it may produce unexpected behavior.  
- **Hardcoded Command Format:** Always executes `"load <gameName>"`, which may not be flexible enough if different loading mechanisms are required in the future.  
- **No Error Handling:** If the game name is too short (fewer than four characters), an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` could occur. Adding validation would improve robustness.  
- **Lack of UI Feedback:** No confirmation message is displayed to indicate whether the game was successfully loaded. Consider adding a message or visual indicator.

---

## **MapButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `MapButton` class handles user interaction with a button designed to display the map panel in the game interface.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Detect button clicks.  
2. Update the game engine to display the map panel.  

### **Constructor**  
- `MapButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`:  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine and the panel that represents the map.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `setMapPanel(this.panel)` on the game engine to switch the display to the map panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Assumes Panel is a Map Panel:** The constructor accepts any `GamePanel` without verifying if it actually represents a map. If the wrong panel is passed, unexpected behavior may occur.  
- **Lack of Confirmation or Feedback:** The method changes the panel but does not provide any confirmation to the user. Consider adding a visual indicator or a log message.  
- **No Null Checks:** If `panel` or `game` is `null`, the program may crash. Adding a null check would improve robustness.  
- **Limited Functionality:** This button only switches to the map panel. If additional actions (such as refreshing the map) are needed, the method might need to be extended.

---

## **QuitButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `QuitButton` class handles user interaction with a button designed to either close the game or restart it, depending on the provided configuration.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Close the game window if restarting is not required.  
2. Restart the game with a new game instance if the restart flag is `true`.  
3. Update the game panel after restarting the game.  

### **Constructor**  
- `QuitButton(GameFrame frame, boolean restart, GameEngine game, GamePanel panel)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game frame, a flag to determine whether to restart the game, the game engine, and a panel to display after restarting.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - If `restart` is `false`, disposes of the game window.  
   - If `restart` is `true`, resets the game by creating a new `Game` and `Player` instance, then updates the panel.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Game Restart Logic Might Not Preserve Progress**: The restart process initializes a new `Game` and `Player` without saving any previous state. If saving game progress is needed, additional logic should be implemented.  
- **No Confirmation Before Closing**: The game window closes immediately without asking the user for confirmation. Consider adding a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental closures.  
- **Hardcoded `new Game()` and `new Player()`**: If a different method of resetting the game is needed in the future (e.g., loading a saved state), this approach may need modification.  
- **Potential `null` Issues**: If `game` or `panel` is `null`, calling methods on them could cause a `NullPointerException`. Adding null checks would improve robustness.

## **SearchGameButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `SearchGameButton` class allows users to navigate through a list of available game saves, either moving to the next or previous entry.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Handle user interaction with a button for navigating game saves.  
2. Increase the game load index when moving to the next save.  
3. Decrease the game load index when moving to the previous save.  

### **Constructor**  
- `SearchGameButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, boolean next)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, game panel, and a boolean flag indicating whether to move forward (`true`) or backward (`false`).  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Calls `increaseLoad(panel)` if `next` is `true`, moving forward in the save list.  
   - Calls `decreaseLoad(panel)` if `next` is `false`, moving backward in the save list.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **No Bounds Checking on Load Index**: If `increaseLoad` or `decreaseLoad` is called without validation, it may attempt to navigate past the first or last available save. Consider adding checks to prevent out-of-bounds errors.  
- **Button Behavior Not Explicitly Defined**: It is unclear what happens when no saves exist. Implementing proper UI feedback (e.g., disabling the button) would improve usability.  
- **Panel May Not Need to Be Passed**: If `panel` is only used for updating the display, consider handling UI updates within `increaseLoad` and `decreaseLoad` instead of passing `panel` as a parameter.

---

## **ShelterButton**  

### **Overview**  
The `ShelterButton` class handles user interaction for moving the player to a specific location,  representing a shelter or safe area in the game.  

### **Key Responsibilities**  
1. Update the player's current location in the game.  
2. Reset the game's response type to `0`, ensuring normal gameplay interaction.  
3. Update the game panel to reflect the new state.  

### **Constructor**  
- `ShelterButton(GameEngine game, GamePanel panel, int location)`  
  - Initializes the button with the game engine, game panel, and the target location to move the player.  

### **Methods**  
1. **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0)`**  
   - Resets the game's response type to `0`.  
   - Updates the player's current room to the specified location.  
   - Sets the game panel to update the UI.  

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  
- **Lack of Validation on Location**: If `location` is invalid (e.g., out of bounds or null), it could cause unexpected behavior. Consider adding validation.  
- **No Confirmation for Movement**: If the move is irreversible or important, a confirmation dialog could prevent accidental clicks.  
- **Panel Update Assumes Immediate Transition**: If additional game logic is needed (e.g., animations or events triggering), consider handling this within `setGamePanel()`.

### Data Package

## **Constants**

### **Overview**
The `Constants` class is a utility class that defines a set of **public static final** constants. These constants are used to store fixed values that are shared across the application, such as configuration values, limits, or identifiers. The class does not have any behavior (methods) or state (instance variables) and is intended to be used as a centralized place for constant values.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Storing Game Configuration**: Holds constants related to the game's structure, such as the number of rooms, items, verbs, and nouns.
2. **Defining Item Limits**: Stores thresholds or identifiers for specific item types (e.g., `foodLine` and `drinkLine`).
3. **Providing UI Utilities**: Includes a string (`line`) and its length (`lineLength`) for use as a visual separator or divider in the UI.

### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. Since all fields are `static`, there is no need to instantiate the class. It is intended to be used as a static utility class.

### **Methods**
The class does not define any methods. It only contains static fields.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Non-Final `line` Field**
- **Flaw**: The `line` field is not declared as `final`, which means it can be modified at runtime. This contradicts the purpose of a constants class, where all fields should be immutable.
- **Change**: Declare `line` as `final` to ensure immutability:
  ```java
  public static final String line = "----------------------------------------------------------------";
  ```

#### **2. Hardcoded `line` String**
- **Flaw**: The `line` string is hardcoded, which makes it less flexible. If `lineLength` changes, the `line` string will not automatically reflect the new length.
- **Change**: Generate the `line` string dynamically based on `lineLength`:
  ```java
  public static final String line = "-".repeat(lineLength);
  ```

#### **3. Lack of Grouping for Related Constants**
- **Flaw**: Constants like `foodLine` and `drinkLine` are related but are not grouped together. This can make the class harder to navigate and understand.
- **Change**: Group related constants in a nested class or use an `enum` for better organization:
  ```java
  public static final class ItemLimits {
      public static final int FOOD = 16;
      public static final int DRINK = 21;
  }
  ```

#### **4. Non-Descriptive Field Names**
- **Flaw**: Some field names (e.g., `noRooms`, `noItems`) are not very descriptive and could be improved for better readability.
- **Change**: Use more descriptive names:
  ```java
  public static final int NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 80;
  public static final int NUMBER_OF_ITEMS = 43;
  ```

#### **5. No Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: All fields are `public`, which exposes them to direct modification (if not `final`) and reduces encapsulation.
- **Change**: While constants are typically `public`, consider using a private constructor to prevent instantiation of the class:
  ```java
  private Constants() {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class");
  }
  ```

#### **6. Potential for Overloading**
- **Flaw**: The class could become bloated if too many unrelated constants are added in the future.
- **Change**: Split the class into multiple smaller classes or enums based on the context of the constants (e.g., `GameConstants`, `UIConstants`).

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s how the class could look after applying the suggested changes:

```java
public final class Constants {

    // Prevent instantiation
    private Constants() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class");
    }

    // Game-related constants
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 80;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_ITEMS = 43;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_VERBS = 42;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_NOUNS = 52;
    public static final int CARRIABLE_ITEMS = 24;

    // Item type limits
    public static final class ItemLimits {
        public static final int FOOD = 16;
        public static final int DRINK = 21;
    }

    // UI-related constants
    public static final int SEPARATOR_LINE_LENGTH = 90;
    public static final String SEPARATOR_LINE = "-".repeat(SEPARATOR_LINE_LENGTH);
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. Made `line` final and dynamically generated it.
2. Grouped related constants (`foodLine` and `drinkLine`) into a nested class.
3. Improved field names for better readability.
4. Added a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
5. Ensured all fields are `final` for immutability.

Here’s the analysis of your `Item` class using the provided template:

---

## **Item**

### **Overview**
The `Item` class represents an item in the game. It stores information about the item, such as its description, location, and flags, and provides methods to manipulate and query this information. The class implements the `Serializable` interface, allowing instances of `Item` to be serialized and deserialized.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Storing Item Information**: Holds data about the item, including its description, location, and flags.
2. **Validating Item Location**: Provides a method to check if the item is present at a specific location.
3. **Manipulating Item State**: Allows modification of the item's location, flag, description, and wisdom-gained status.
4. **Serialization Support**: Implements `Serializable` to enable object serialization.

### **Constructor**
- **`Item(char flag, char location, String item)`**
  - Initializes an `Item` object with the provided `flag`, `location`, and `description`.
  - Converts the `flag` and `location` characters to integers using specific logic:
    - `flag` is converted by subtracting `48` (ASCII value of `'0'`).
    - `location` is converted by subtracting `32` (ASCII value of space). If the result is greater than `127`, it is further adjusted by subtracting `96`.
  - Saves the item description.

### **Methods**
1. **`getItem()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's description.
   - **Usage**: Used to retrieve the textual representation of the item.

2. **`checkLocation(int location)`**
   - **Description**: Checks if the item is present at the specified location.
   - **Usage**: Used to determine if the item is located at a given place in the game.

3. **`getFlag()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's flag.
   - **Usage**: Retrieves the flag associated with the item.

4. **`getLocation()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the item's current location.
   - **Usage**: Retrieves the location of the item.

5. **`setLocation(int newLocation)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's location.
   - **Usage**: Used to move the item to a new location.

6. **`setFlag(int flag)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's flag.
   - **Usage**: Modifies the flag associated with the item.

7. **`setDescription(String description)`**
   - **Description**: Updates the item's description.
   - **Usage**: Changes the textual representation of the item.

8. **`setWisdomGain()`**
   - **Description**: Toggles the `wisdomGained` status of the item.
   - **Usage**: Used to indicate whether wisdom has been gained from the item.

9. **`checkWisdomGain()`**
   - **Description**: Returns the current state of `wisdomGained`.
   - **Usage**: Checks if wisdom has been gained from the item.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers in Constructor**
- **Flaw**: The constructor uses magic numbers (`48`, `32`, `127`, `96`) for character-to-integer conversion. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or provide comments explaining their purpose:
  ```java
  private static final int FLAG_OFFSET = 48; // ASCII value of '0'
  private static final int LOCATION_OFFSET = 32; // ASCII value of space
  private static final int LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT = 96; // Adjustment for values > 127
  ```

#### **2. Lack of Validation**
- **Flaw**: The constructor and setter methods do not validate input values (e.g., negative locations or invalid flags).
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure values are within expected ranges:
  ```java
  if (location < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Location cannot be negative");
  }
  ```

#### **3. Inconsistent Naming**
- **Flaw**: The field `item` and method `getItem()` use inconsistent naming. The field should be renamed to `description` for clarity.
- **Change**: Rename the field and update the method:
  ```java
  private String description;
  public String getDescription() {
      return this.description;
  }
  ```

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- **Flaw**: The `itemFlag` and `itemLocation` fields are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after object creation. This reduces the predictability of the class.
- **Change**: If these fields should not change after initialization, make them `final` and remove the setter methods.

#### **5. Serialization Risks**
- **Flaw**: The class implements `Serializable` but does not handle potential serialization issues (e.g., changes to the class structure over time).
- **Change**: Ensure the `serialVersionUID` is updated if the class structure changes significantly. Consider adding custom serialization logic if needed.

#### **6. Boolean Toggle Logic**
- **Flaw**: The `setWisdomGain()` method toggles the `wisdomGained` field, which might be unintuitive for users of the class.
- **Change**: Replace the toggle method with explicit `setWisdomGain(boolean)`:
  ```java
  public void setWisdomGain(boolean wisdomGained) {
      this.wisdomGained = wisdomGained;
  }
  ```

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s how the class could look after applying the suggested changes:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Item implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -2697850646469797958L;

    // Constants for character-to-integer conversion
    private static final int FLAG_OFFSET = 48; // ASCII value of '0'
    private static final int LOCATION_OFFSET = 32; // ASCII value of space
    private static final int LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT = 96; // Adjustment for values > 127

    private int itemFlag;
    private int itemLocation;
    private String description;
    private boolean wisdomGained = false;

    public Item(char flag, char location, String description) {
        // Convert characters to integers
        this.itemFlag = (int) flag - FLAG_OFFSET;
        this.itemLocation = (int) location - LOCATION_OFFSET;

        if (this.itemLocation > 127) {
            this.itemLocation -= LOCATION_ADJUSTMENT;
        }

        // Validate input
        if (this.itemLocation < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid location value");
        }

        // Save description
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return this.description;
    }

    public boolean checkLocation(int location) {
        return location == this.itemLocation;
    }

    public int getFlag() {
        return this.itemFlag;
    }

    public int getLocation() {
        return this.itemLocation;
    }

    public void setLocation(int newLocation) {
        if (newLocation < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Location cannot be negative");
        }
        this.itemLocation = newLocation;
    }

    public void setFlag(int flag) {
        this.itemFlag = flag;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public void setWisdomGain(boolean wisdomGained) {
        this.wisdomGained = wisdomGained;
    }

    public boolean checkWisdomGain() {
        return this.wisdomGained;
    }
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. Replaced magic numbers with named constants.
2. Added input validation in the constructor and setter methods.
3. Renamed the `item` field to `description` for clarity.
4. Improved the `setWisdomGain()` method to accept a boolean parameter.
5. Added comments to explain the purpose of constants and logic.

## **Location**

### **Overview**

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Stores information about a location, including its name, exits, visitation status, and type.
2. Parses the location name to determine available exits.
3. Tracks whether the location has been visited or viewed.
4. Supports serialization for saving and loading game states.

### **Constructor**
- **`Location(String name, String[] prepositions, String roomType)`**
  - Initializes a `Location` object with the provided `name`, `prepositions`, and `roomType`.
  - Parses the `name` string to extract the preposition and determine the available exits.
  - The `name` string is expected to have a specific format:
    - The first character represents an index into the `prepositions` array.
    - The last four characters represent the exits (e.g., `"0"` for an open exit, other values for closed exits).
  - Sets the `roomType` and initializes the `exits` array based on the parsed data.

### **Methods**
1. **`getName()`**
   - Returns the formatted name of the location.

2. **`getExits()`**
   - Returns an array of booleans representing the available exits.

3. **`setVisited()`**
   - Marks the location as visited.

4. **`getVisited()`**
   - Returns whether the location has been visited.

5. **`setViewed()`**
   - Marks the location as viewed.

6. **`getViewed()`**
   - Returns whether the location has been viewed.

7. **`getRoomType()`**
   - Returns the type of the room.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers and String Manipulation**
- The constructor uses hardcoded indices (`0`, `1`, `name.length()-4`) for string manipulation, which makes the code less readable and maintainable.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants:
  ```java
  private static final int PREPOSITION_INDEX = 0;
  private static final int EXIT_START_INDEX = name.length() - 4;
  ```

#### **2. Lack of Input Validation**
- The constructor does not validate the input parameters (e.g., `name`, `prepositions`, `roomType`). Invalid input could lead to runtime errors.
- **Change**: Add validation:
  ```java
  if (name == null || name.length() < 5) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid name format");
  }
  if (prepositions == null || prepositions.length == 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Prepositions array cannot be null or empty");
  }
  ```

#### **3. Inefficient String Parsing**
- The constructor uses `substring` multiple times to parse the `name` string, which can be inefficient.
- **Change**: Use a single `substring` call:
  ```java
  String exitString = name.substring(name.length() - 4);
  ```

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- The `name` and `roomType` fields are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after object creation.
- **Change**: Make them `final` if they should not change after initialization.

#### **5. Boolean Array for Exits**
- The `exits` array uses a boolean to represent each exit, which limits flexibility (e.g., cannot represent different types of exits).
- **Change**: Use an `enum` to represent exit types:
  ```java
  public enum ExitType {
      OPEN,
      CLOSED,
      LOCKED
  }
  private ExitType[] exits = new ExitType[4];
  ```

### **Improved Version of the Class**
```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Location implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 7421397108414613755L;

    private static final int PREPOSITION_INDEX = 0;
    private static final int EXIT_START_INDEX = 4;

    private final String name;
    private final boolean[] exits = new boolean[4];
    private boolean visited = false;
    private boolean viewed = false;
    private final String roomType;

    public Location(String name, String[] prepositions, String roomType) {
        if (name == null || name.length() < 5) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid name format");
        }
        if (prepositions == null || prepositions.length == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Prepositions array cannot be null or empty");
        }

        int prepIndex = Integer.parseInt(name.substring(PREPOSITION_INDEX, PREPOSITION_INDEX + 1)) - 1;
        this.name = String.format("%s %s", prepositions[prepIndex], name.substring(1, name.length() - EXIT_START_INDEX));
        this.roomType = roomType;

        String exitString = name.substring(name.length() - EXIT_START_INDEX);
        for (int i = 0; i < exits.length; i++) {
            exits[i] = exitString.charAt(i) == '0';
        }
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public boolean[] getExits() {
        return this.exits.clone();
    }

    public void setVisited() {
        this.visited = true;
    }

    public boolean getVisited() {
        return this.visited;
    }

## **RawData**

### **Overview**

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Stores static data for locations, objects, verbs, nouns, and prepositions.
2. Provides methods to retrieve specific data based on indices or other criteria.
3. Acts as a centralized repository for game-related constants and configurations.


### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. It is a utility class with only static fields and methods.


### **Methods**
1. **`getLocation(int number)`**
   - Returns the location string at the specified index from the `locations` array.

2. **`getImage(int number)`**
   - Returns the image string associated with the location type at the specified index.

3. **`getObjects(int number)`**
   - Returns the object string at the specified index from the `objects` array.

4. **`getPrepositions()`**
   - Returns the array of prepositions.

5. **`getItemLocation(int number)`**
   - Returns the character at the specified index from the `itemLocation` string.

6. **`getItemFlag(int number)`**
   - Returns the character at the specified index from the `itemFlag` string.

7. **`getVerbs()`**
   - Returns the array of verbs.

8. **`getNouns()`**
   - Returns the array of nouns.


### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Data**
- The class contains hardcoded data (e.g., `locationTypes`, `locations`, `objects`), which makes it inflexible and harder to maintain.
- **Change**: Consider loading this data from an external file (e.g., JSON, XML) to make it easier to update and manage.

#### **2. Lack of Encapsulation**
- All fields are `static` and `public`, which exposes them to direct modification and reduces encapsulation.
- **Change**: Make fields `private` and provide static getter methods for access.

#### **3. Inefficient Data Retrieval**
- The `getImage` method uses `locationTypes[number-1]` to index into `locationImage`, which could lead to confusion or errors if `number` is out of bounds.
- **Change**: Add bounds checking to prevent `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### **4. Immutable Fields**
- Some fields (e.g., `itemLocation`, `itemFlag`) are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after initialization.
- **Change**: Make these fields `final` to ensure immutability.

#### **5. Poor Readability**
- The `locations` and `objects` arrays contain long strings with no comments or explanations, making it hard to understand their structure.
- **Change**: Add comments or split the data into smaller, more manageable chunks.

#### **6. No Input Validation**
- Methods like `getLocation`, `getImage`, and `getObjects` do not validate the input `number`, which could lead to runtime errors.
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure the input is within the valid range.

### Model Package

## **CommandProcess**

### **Overview**
The `CommandProcess` class is responsible for processing and executing player commands in a game. It parses input commands, identifies the verb and noun, and delegates the execution to the appropriate methods in the `Commands` class. It also handles post-command updates, such as adjusting player stats, updating game state, and triggering events.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Command Parsing**: Splits and processes the player's input command into a verb and noun.
2. **Command Execution**: Delegates the execution of commands to the `Commands` class based on the verb and noun.
3. **Post-Command Updates**: Handles game state updates, such as adjusting player stats, triggering events, and managing NPC behavior.
4. **Special Command Handling**: Manages special commands like movement, item interactions, and game state changes (e.g., loading, saving, quitting).

### **Constructor**
1. **`CommandProcess(String command, Game game)`**
   - Initializes the class with the player's input command and the current game state.
   - Processes the command by splitting it into a verb and noun.
   - Handles special cases (e.g., converting "north" to "n").

2. **`CommandProcess()`**
   - Default constructor with no parameters.

### **Methods**
1. **`getGame()`**
   - Returns the current `Game` object.

2. **`getPlayer()`**
   - Returns the current `Player` object.

3. **`checkLoadedGame()`**
   - Returns whether a game has been loaded.

4. **`fixCommand(String command)`**
   - Converts shorthand or alternative commands into their canonical forms (e.g., "north" → "n").

5. **`getVerbNumber()`**
   - Returns the index of the verb in the `verbs` array.

6. **`getNounNumber()`**
   - Returns the index of the noun in the `nouns` array.

7. **`getNounNum(String noun)`**
   - Helper method to find the index of a noun in the `nouns` array.

8. **`codeCommand(int room, int nounNumber, Item item)`**
   - Generates a coded command string based on the noun, item location, item flag, and room.

9. **`executeCommand(Game game, Player player, int nounNumber)`**
   - Executes the parsed command by delegating to the appropriate method in the `Commands` class.

10. **`postUpdates(Game game, Player player)`**
    - Handles post-command updates, such as adjusting player stats, triggering events, and managing NPC behavior.

11. **`executeGive(Game game, Player player, int nounNumber, String subject, String codedNoun)`**
    - Handles the "give" command, including special cases like giving items to NPCs.

12. **`executeShelter(Game game, Player player, int location)`**
    - Handles the "shelter" command, moving the player to a safe location.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Tight Coupling with `Commands` Class**
- **Flaw**: The `CommandProcess` class is tightly coupled with the `Commands` class, making it difficult to modify or extend command behavior.
- **Change**: Consider using a **command pattern** or **strategy pattern** to decouple command execution from the `CommandProcess` class.

#### **2. Hardcoded Logic**
- **Flaw**: The class contains hardcoded logic for specific commands (e.g., "give", "shelter"), making it inflexible and harder to maintain.
- **Change**: Move command-specific logic into separate classes or methods to improve modularity.

#### **3. Lack of Input Validation**
- **Flaw**: The class does not validate input commands thoroughly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Change**: Add input validation to ensure commands are well-formed and within expected bounds.

#### **4. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `verbNo == 11` for "eat"), making the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **5. Complex Post-Command Logic**
- **Flaw**: The `postUpdates` method is overly complex and handles too many unrelated tasks.
- **Change**: Break down `postUpdates` into smaller, more focused methods or classes.

#### **6. Inefficient String Manipulation**
- **Flaw**: The class uses inefficient string manipulation (e.g., `substring`, `equals`) in some methods.
- **Change**: Optimize string handling by using more efficient data structures or algorithms.

#### **7. Lack of Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: Some fields (e.g., `splitCommand`, `codedCommand`) are exposed directly, reducing encapsulation.
- **Change**: Make fields `private` and provide getter/setter methods for access.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `CommandProcess` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Tight Coupling with `Game` and `Player`**
- **Flaw**: The class is tightly coupled with the `Game` and `Player` classes, making it difficult to modify or extend functionality.
- **Change**: Consider using a **command pattern** or **strategy pattern** to decouple command execution from the `Commands` class.

#### **2. Hardcoded Logic**
- **Flaw**: The class contains hardcoded logic for specific commands (e.g., "give", "take"), making it inflexible and harder to maintain.
- **Change**: Move command-specific logic into separate classes or methods to improve modularity.

#### **3. Lack of Input Validation**
- **Flaw**: The class does not validate input commands thoroughly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Change**: Add input validation to ensure commands are well-formed and within expected bounds.

#### **4. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `verbNo == 11` for "eat"), making the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **5. Complex Command Handling**
- **Flaw**: Some methods (e.g., `executeCommand`, `postUpdates`) are overly complex and handle too many unrelated tasks.
- **Change**: Break down complex methods into smaller, more focused methods or classes.

#### **6. Inefficient String Manipulation**
- **Flaw**: The class uses inefficient string manipulation (e.g., `substring`, `equals`) in some methods.
- **Change**: Optimize string handling by using more efficient data structures or algorithms.

#### **7. Lack of Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: Some fields (e.g., `verb`, `noun`, `code`) are exposed directly, reducing encapsulation.
- **Change**: Make fields `private` and provide getter/setter methods for access.

### **Improved Version of the Class**

- **Flaw**: Some instance variables (e.g., `message`, `commands`) are exposed directly, reducing encapsulation.
- **Change**: Make instance variables `private` and provide getter/setter methods for access.

#### **4. Complex Message Handling**
- **Flaw**: The `addMessage` method handles message formatting in a way that could lead to inconsistent output.
- **Change**: Use a `StringBuilder` or dedicated message formatting utility for better control over message construction.

#### **5. Inefficient Exit Handling**
- **Flaw**: The `getExits` and `getSpecialExits` methods use hardcoded logic for special exits, which is inefficient and hard to maintain.
- **Change**: Use a data-driven approach (e.g., a map or configuration file) to manage special exits.

#### **6. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `roomNumber == 39` for special exit logic), making the code harder to understand.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **7. Limited Scalability**
- **Flaw**: The class assumes a fixed number of rooms and items, which limits scalability.
- **Change**: Use dynamic data structures (e.g., `List` instead of arrays) to allow for a variable number of rooms and items.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `Game` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

                                                RawData.getPrepositions(),
                                                RawData.getImage(roomNumber));
            locationList.add(newLocation);
        }
        locationList.get(23).setVisited();

        // Initialize items
        for (int itemNumber = 1; itemNumber < noItems + 1; itemNumber++) {
            String item = itemNumber <= Constants.noItems ? RawData.getObjects(itemNumber) : "";
            Item newItem = new Item(RawData.getItemFlag(itemNumber),
                                    RawData.getItemLocation(itemNumber),
                                    item);
            itemList.add(newItem);
        }
    }

    // Other methods remain largely unchanged but can be refactored similarly
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Decoupled Initialization**: Moved game initialization logic into a separate method (`initializeGame`).
2. **Dynamic Data Structures**: Replaced arrays with `List` for `locationList` and `itemList` to improve scalability.
3. **Improved Encapsulation**: Made instance variables `private` and provided getter/setter methods.
4. **Removed Magic Numbers**: Replaced hardcoded values with constants or configuration.
5. **Simplified Message Handling**: Used `StringBuilder` for message construction.

## **GameEngine**

### **Overview**
The `GameEngine` class acts as the central controller for the game, managing interactions between the player, game state, and UI. It processes player commands, updates the game state, and determines which UI panels to display based on the current game context. It also handles special game events, such as swimming in poisoned waters or displaying messages.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Command Processing**: Processes player commands and delegates execution to the `CommandProcess` class.
2. **Game State Management**: Updates the game state based on player actions and events.
3. **UI Panel Management**: Determines which UI panel to display (e.g., game panel, message panel, map panel).
4. **Special Event Handling**: Manages special events like swimming in poisoned waters or displaying lightning effects.
5. **Save/Load Integration**: Supports saving and loading game states.
6. **Game End Conditions**: Checks for game end conditions and calculates the final score.

### **Instance Variables**
- **`private Game game`**: The current game state.
- **`private Player player`**: The player object representing the player's state.
- **`private String[] commands`**: Array to store the last three player commands.
- **`private String codedCommand`**: A coded representation of the current command.
- **`private int nounNum`**: The noun number associated with the current command.
- **`private Test test`**: A testing utility for debugging or development purposes.

### **Constructor**
- **`GameEngine(Game game, Player player)`**

8. **`getSpecialExits()`**
   - Returns a description of special exits (e.g., doors, portals) in the player's current location.

9. **`getMessage()`**
   - Returns the current game message and clears it afterward.

10. **`getCommands()`**
    - Returns the last three player commands.

11. **`increaseLoad(GamePanel game)`**
    - Increases the count for loading saved games and processes the "load" command.

12. **`decreaseLoad(GamePanel game)`**
    - Decreases the count for loading saved games and processes the "load" command.

13. **`processCommand(String command, GamePanel game)`**
    - Processes the player's command, updates the game state, and determines which UI panel to display.

14. **`getResponseType()`**
    - Returns the type of response required from the player (e.g., for "give" or "shelter" commands).

15. **`processGive(String object, GamePanel game)`**
    - Processes the "give" command, allowing the player to give items to NPCs or other entities.

16. **`processShelter(String object, GamePanel game)`**
    - Processes the "shelter" command, allowing the player to seek shelter during storms.

17. **`setPanel(JPanel game, JPanel panel)`**

24. **`restart(Game game, Player player)`**
    - Restarts the game with a new `Game` and `Player` object.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Tight Coupling with UI**
- **Flaw**: The class is tightly coupled with the `GamePanel` and other UI components, making it difficult to reuse or test.
- **Change**: Use an interface or abstract class to decouple the game logic from the UI.

#### **2. Hardcoded Logic**
- **Flaw**: The class contains hardcoded logic for special events (e.g., swimming in poisoned waters), making it inflexible.
- **Change**: Move special event logic into separate classes or configuration files.

#### **3. Lack of Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: Some methods (e.g., `setPanel`, `resetPanel`) directly manipulate UI components, reducing encapsulation.
- **Change**: Use a dedicated UI manager class to handle UI updates.

#### **4. Inefficient Command Processing**
- **Flaw**: The `processCommand` method handles both command processing and UI updates, making it overly complex.
- **Change**: Split the method into smaller, more focused methods (e.g., one for command processing and one for UI updates).

#### **5. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `player.getPanelFlag() == 4` for swimming), making the code harder to understand.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **6. Limited Scalability**
- **Flaw**: The class assumes a fixed structure for commands and responses, which limits scalability.
- **Change**: Use a data-driven approach (e.g., a map or configuration file) to manage commands and responses.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `GameEngine` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

```java
public class GameEngine {

        }
        player.updateDisplayRoom();
        return String.format("You are %s", game.getRoomName(player.getDisplayRoom()));
    }

    public String getItems() {
        return player.getPanelFlag() == 0 ? game.getItems(player.getDisplayRoom()) : "";
    }

        if (player.getPanelFlag() == 4 && player.getStrength() < 15) {
            game.addMessage("|You are very weak!");
        }
        if (player.getPanelFlag() == 4) {
            game.addMessage("|||Which Way?");
        }
        String message = game.getMessage();
        game.clearMessage();
        return message;
    }

    public String[] getCommands() {
        return this.commands;
    }

    public void increaseLoad(GamePanel game) {
        this.game.increaseCount();
        processCommand("load", game);
    }

    public void decreaseLoad(GamePanel game) {
        this.game.decreaseCount();
        processCommand("load", game);
    }

    public void processCommand(String command, GamePanel game) {
        updateCommandHistory(command);

        if (player.getPanelFlag() != 4) {
            CommandProcess processCommands = new CommandProcess(command, this.game);
            int verbNumber = processCommands.getVerbNumber();
            int nounNumber = processCommands.getNounNumber();

            if (verbNumber > Constants.noVerbs || nounNumber == Constants.noNouns) {
                this.game.setMessage("You can't " + command);
            }

            if (nounNumber == -1) {
                nounNumber = Constants.noNouns;
            }

            this.player.update();
            Item item = this.game.getItem(nounNumber);
            this.codedCommand = processCommands.codeCommand(this.player.getRoom(), nounNumber, item);
            processCommands.executeCommand(this.game, player, nounNumber);

            if (processCommands.checkLoadedGame()) {
                this.game = processCommands.getGame();
                this.player = processCommands.getPlayer();
            }

            test.displayValue(this.game, this.player);
            determinePanel(game);
        } else {
            handleSwimming(command, game);
        }
    }

    private void updateCommandHistory(String command) {
        if (this.commands[0].isEmpty()) {
            this.commands[0] = command;
        } else if (this.commands[1].isEmpty()) {
            this.commands[1] = command;
        } else if (this.commands[2].isEmpty()) {
            this.commands[2] = command;
        } else {
            this.commands[0] = this.commands[1];
            this.commands[1] = this.commands[2];
            this.commands[2] = command;
        }
    }

    private void handleSwimming(String command, GamePanel game) {
        this.game.setMessage("Ok");

        if (command.startsWith("n")) {
            player.adjustPosition();
        } else if (!command.startsWith("s") && !command.startsWith("e") && !command.startsWith("w")) {
            this.game.setMessage("I do not understand");
        }

        float strengthAdj = (float) ((player.getWeight() / Constants.noNouns + 0.1) - 3);
        player.adjustStrength(strengthAdj);

        if (player.checkPosition()) {
            player.setPanelFlag(0);
            this.game.setMessage("You surface");
            player.setRoom(new Random().nextInt(3) + 31);
            player.resetPosition();
        } else if (player.getStrength() < 1) {
            this.game.setMessage("You get lost and drown");
            player.setPanelFlag(0);
            this.game.endGame();
        }

        test.displayValue(this.game, this.player);
        resetPanel(game);
    }

    // Other methods remain largely unchanged but can be refactored similarly
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Decoupled UI Logic**: Moved UI-related logic into helper methods and improved encapsulation.
2. **Improved Command Processing**: Split the `processCommand` method into smaller, more focused methods.
3. **Removed Magic Numbers**: Replaced hardcoded values with constants or configuration.
4. **Simplified Special Event Handling**: Moved swimming logic into a dedicated method (`handleSwimming`).

## **Main**

### **Overview**
The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the game application. It initializes the game data, creates the player, and launches the game UI in a separate thread using Swing's event dispatch thread. This ensures that the game runs smoothly without blocking the main thread.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Game Initialization**: Initializes the game data (`Game`), player (`Player`), and game engine (`GameEngine`).
2. **UI Launch**: Launches the game UI (`GameFrame`) in a separate thread using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.

### **Instance Variables**
- None. The class does not maintain any state and is purely used for initialization and launching.

### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. It uses a default constructor.

### **Methods**
1. **`startGame()`**
   - Initializes the game data, player, and game engine.
   - Launches the game UI in a separate thread using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Lack of Flexibility**
- **Flaw**: The `startGame` method is tightly coupled to specific implementations of `Game`, `Player`, and `GameEngine`.
- **Change**: Use dependency injection or a factory pattern to allow for different implementations of these classes.

#### **2. No Error Handling**
- **Flaw**: The method does not handle potential errors during initialization or UI launch.
- **Change**: Add error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks) to gracefully handle exceptions.

#### **3. Limited Extensibility**
- **Flaw**: The class is not designed to support additional features like command-line arguments or configuration options.
- **Change**: Add support for command-line arguments or configuration files to customize game behavior.

#### **4. Hardcoded UI Launch**
- **Flaw**: The UI launch logic is hardcoded, making it difficult to switch to a different UI framework.
- **Change**: Use an interface or abstract class to decouple the UI launch logic from the `Main` class.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `Main` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

```java
public class Main {

    public void startGame() {
        try {
            // Initialize game data
            Game gameData = new Game();
            Player player = new Player();
            GameEngine game = new GameEngine(gameData, player);

            // Launch the game UI in a separate thread
            SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> new GameFrame(game));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to start the game: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.startGame();
    }
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Error Handling**: Added a try-catch block to handle potential errors during initialization and UI launch.
2. **Lambda Expression**: Replaced the anonymous inner class with a lambda expression for cleaner code.
3. **Main Method**: Added a `main` method to allow the class to be executed directly.

### **Additional Suggestions**
1. **Command-Line Arguments**: Extend the `Main` class to support command-line arguments for customizing game behavior (e.g., loading a specific save file).
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Main main = new Main();
       if (args.length > 0 && args[0].equals("--load")) {
           main.loadGame(args[1]); // Load a specific save file
       } else {
           main.startGame(); // Start a new game
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Configuration File**: Use a configuration file (e.g., JSON or properties file) to customize game settings.
   ```java
   Properties config = new Properties();
   try (InputStream input = Main.class.getResourceAsStream("/config.properties")) {
       config.load(input);
       String gameMode = config.getProperty("game.mode", "default");
       // Use gameMode to customize game behavior
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.err.println("Failed to load configuration: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

3. **Dependency Injection**: Use a dependency injection framework (e.g., Spring or Guice) to manage dependencies between classes.
   ```java
   Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new GameModule());
   GameEngine game = injector.getInstance(GameEngine.class);
   SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> new GameFrame(game));
   ```

It manages the player's state, including their location, strength, wisdom, time remaining, inventory (food, drink, weight), and special conditions like swimming in poisoned waters. The class implements `Serializable` to support saving and loading the player's state.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Player State Management**: Tracks the player's current state, including location, strength, wisdom, time, and inventory.
2. **Special Conditions**: Manages special conditions like swimming in poisoned waters.
3. **Stat Updates**: Updates the player's stats (e.g., strength, time) based on game events.
4. **Serialization Support**: Allows the player's state to be saved and loaded.

### **Instance Variables**
- **`private static final long serialVersionUID`**: Unique identifier for serialization.
- **`private int room`**: The player's current room.
- **`private int roomToDisplay`**: The room to display (used for special conditions like random room display).
- **`private float strength`**: The player's strength stat.
- **`private int wisdom`**: The player's wisdom stat.
- **`private int timeRemaining`**: The remaining time for the player to complete the game.
- **`private int weight`**: The player's current weight (based on carried items).
- **`private int food`**: The player's food inventory.
- **`private int drink`**: The player's drink inventory.
- **`private Random rand`**: Random number generator for game events.
- **`private int panelFlag`**: Flag to determine the current UI panel (e.g., normal screen, give screen, lightning flashes).
- **`private int swimming`**: Tracks if the player is swimming in poisoned waters.
- **`private int swimPosition`**: Tracks the player's progress while swimming.

### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. It uses a default constructor.

### **Methods**
1. **`getDisplayRoom()`**
   - Returns the room to display (used for special conditions like random room display).

2. **`updateDisplayRoom()`**
   - Updates the room to display based on the player's current room and special conditions.

3. **`getStatus()`**
   - Returns a formatted string with the player's strength and wisdom stats.

4. **`update()`**

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Lack of Encapsulation**
- **Flaw**: Some methods (e.g., `setRoom`, `setStrength`) directly modify instance variables, reducing encapsulation.
- **Change**: Use private setters and provide public methods for controlled modifications.

#### **2. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `this.room == 20` for random room display), making the code harder to understand.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **3. Inefficient Stat Updates**
- **Flaw**: The `update` method recalculates strength based on weight every time, which may be inefficient.
- **Change**: Cache the strength calculation or update it only when necessary.

#### **4. Limited Extensibility**
- **Flaw**: The class is not designed to support additional stats or conditions.
- **Change**: Use a data-driven approach (e.g., a map or configuration file) to manage stats and conditions.

#### **5. No Error Handling**
- **Flaw**: The class does not handle potential errors (e.g., invalid room numbers or stat values).
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure stats and room numbers are within expected bounds.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `Player` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

```java
public class Player implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 495300605316911022L;

    }

    public void update() {
        this.timeRemaining--;
        this.strength -= (this.weight / Constants.noItems + 0.1);
    }

    public float getStrengthWisdon() {
        return this.strength + this.wisdom;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getRoom() {
        return this.room;

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Encapsulation**: Added validation to setters to ensure stats and room numbers are within expected bounds.
2. **Magic Numbers**: Replaced magic numbers with named constants (e.g., `RANDOM_ROOM`).
3. **Error Handling**: Added error handling for invalid input values.
4. **Code Readability**: Improved method and variable names for better readability.

## **Test**

### **Overview**
The `Test` class is a utility class used for debugging and testing purposes. It provides methods to manipulate the game state (`Game`) and player state (`Player`) and to display specific values for debugging. This class is not intended for use in the final game but is helpful during development.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **Game State Manipulation**: Allows temporary modifications to the game state for testing purposes.
2. **Player State Manipulation**: Allows temporary modifications to the player state for testing purposes.
3. **Debugging Output**: Displays specific values (e.g., player stats, item locations) for debugging.

### **Instance Variables**
- None. The class does not maintain any state and is purely used for testing.

### **Constructor**
- The class does not have an explicit constructor. It uses a default constructor.

### **Methods**
1. **`setTest(Game game, Player player)`**
   - Allows temporary modifications to the game and player state for testing purposes.
   - Currently commented out, but can be used to set specific conditions (e.g., player location, item locations).

2. **`displayValue(Game game, Player player)`**
   - Displays specific values (e.g., player stats, item locations) for debugging.
   - Currently commented out, but can be used to print debugging information.

3. **`displayLocations(Game game)`**
   - Displays the names of specific rooms for debugging.
   - Uses a `TreeSet` to store and iterate through a predefined list of room numbers.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Lack of Flexibility**
- **Flaw**: The `setTest` and `displayValue` methods are hardcoded and not flexible for different testing scenarios.
- **Change**: Add parameters to these methods to allow dynamic testing conditions.

#### **2. No Error Handling**
- **Flaw**: The class does not handle potential errors (e.g., invalid room numbers or item IDs).
- **Change**: Add validation to ensure inputs are within expected bounds.

#### **3. Limited Usefulness**
- **Flaw**: The class is not integrated into the game and is only useful during development.
- **Change**: Integrate the class into the game's debugging system or remove it before release.

#### **4. Hardcoded Values**
- **Flaw**: The `displayLocations` method uses hardcoded room numbers, making it inflexible.
- **Change**: Allow the method to accept a list of room numbers as input.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `Test` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

```java
public class Test {

    /**
     * Sets specific conditions for testing purposes.
     *
     * @param game   The game object to modify.
     * @param player The player object to modify.
     */
    public void setTest(Game game, Player player) {
        // Example test conditions (commented out for safety)
        // player.setRoom(60);
        // player.setTime(900);
        // player.setWisdom(80);
        // game.getItem(3).setLocation(0);
        // game.getItem(12).setLocation(0);
        // game.getItem(3).setFlag(0);
        // game.getItem(36).setFlag(-1);
        // game.getItem(13).setLocation(player.getRoom());
        // game.getItem(39).setLocation(player.getRoom());
        // game.getItem(12).setLocation(0);
        // player.setWisdom(80);
    }

    /**
     * Displays specific values for debugging purposes.
     *
     * @param game   The game object to inspect.
     * @param player The player object to inspect.
     */
    public void displayValue(Game game, Player player) {
        // Example debug output (commented out for safety)
        // System.out.println("Player Wisdom: " + player.getWisdom());
        // System.out.println("Item 3: " + game.getItem(3).getItem());
        // System.out.println("Item 16: " + game.getItem(16).getItem());
        // System.out.println("Item 7 Location: " + game.getItem(7).getLocation());
        // System.out.println("Item 36 Flag: " + game.getItem(36).getFlag());
        // System.out.println("Item 11 Flag: " + game.getItem(11).getFlag());
        // System.out.println("Item 13 Flag: " + game.getItem(13).getFlag());
        // System.out.println("Room 33 Name: " + game.getRoomName(33));
        // System.out.println("Item 43 Flag: " + game.getItem(43).getFlag());
        // System.out.println("Item 16 Location: " + game.getItem(16).getLocation());
        // System.out.println("Player Room: " + player.getRoom());
    }

    /**
     * Displays the names of specific rooms for debugging purposes.
     *
     * @param game The game object to inspect.
     */
    public void displayLocations(Game game) {
        // Predefined list of room numbers to display
        Set<Integer> roomNumbers = new TreeSet<>(Set.of(32, 33, 42, 43, 52, 53));

        // Iterate through the set and print each room name
        for (int roomNumber : roomNumbers) {
            System.out.println("Room " + roomNumber + ": " + game.getRoomName(roomNumber));
        }
    }

    /**
     * Displays the names of specified rooms for debugging purposes.
     *
     * @param game        The game object to inspect.
     * @param roomNumbers A set of room numbers to display.
     */
    public void displayLocations(Game game, Set<Integer> roomNumbers) {
        // Validate input
        if (roomNumbers == null || roomNumbers.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Room numbers cannot be null or empty");
        }

        // Iterate through the set and print each room name
        for (int roomNumber : roomNumbers) {
            if (roomNumber < 1 || roomNumber > Constants.noRooms) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid room number: " + roomNumber);
            }
            System.out.println("Room " + roomNumber + ": " + game.getRoomName(roomNumber));
        }
    }
}
```

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Improved Flexibility**: Added a new `displayLocations` method that accepts a set of room numbers as input.
2. **Error Handling**: Added validation to ensure room numbers are within expected bounds.
3. **Code Readability**: Improved method and variable names for better readability.
4. **Documentation**: Added comments to explain the purpose of each method.

### **Additional Suggestions**
1. **Dynamic Testing Conditions**: Extend the `setTest` method to accept parameters for dynamic testing conditions.
   ```java
   public void setTest(Game game, Player player, int room, int time, int wisdom) {
       player.setRoom(room);
       player.setTime(time);
       player.setWisdom(wisdom);
   }
   ```

2. **Logging**: Replace `System.out.println` with a logging framework (e.g., `java.util.logging` or `Log4j`) for better debugging output management.
   ```java
   import java.util.logging.Logger;

   public class Test {
       private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Test.class.getName());

       public void displayValue(Game game, Player player) {
           logger.info("Player Wisdom: " + player.getWisdom());
           logger.info("Item 3: " + game.getItem(3).getItem());
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Integration with Debugging System**: Integrate the `Test` class into the game's debugging system to enable/disable debugging features dynamically.
   ```java
   public class Test {
       private boolean debugEnabled;

       public Test(boolean debugEnabled) {
           this.debugEnabled = debugEnabled;
       }

       public void displayValue(Game game, Player player) {
           if (debugEnabled) {
               System.out.println("Player Wisdom: " + player.getWisdom());
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**  

#### **1. Use of Magic Numbers**  
- **Flaw**: Hardcoded room/item numbers make the code less readable and maintainable.  
- **Change**: Replace hardcoded numbers with named constants.  

#### **2. Inefficient String Concatenation**  
- **Flaw**: Repeated use of `String.format()` for string concatenation can be inefficient.  
- **Change**: Use `StringBuilder` for better performance when constructing messages.  

#### **3. Mixed Responsibilities**  
- **Flaw**: The class handles game state, UI messages, and item logic all in one place.  
- **Change**: Consider refactoring into separate classes for game state management, message handling, and UI logic.  

#### **4. Potentially Inefficient Item Lookups**  
- **Flaw**: The `getItems()` method iterates over the entire `itemList` to check for items in a room.  
- **Change**: Use a `Map<Integer, List<Item>>` to store items by location for faster lookups.  

#### **5. Serialization Without Versioning Strategy**  
- **Flaw**: The class implements `Serializable`, but future changes could break compatibility.  
- **Change**: Implement custom serialization or version management strategies.

## **GamePanel**

### **Overview**
The `GamePanel` class represents the main game interface within the game window. It extends `JPanel` and is responsible for organizing and displaying the game's UI components, including status information, room descriptions, items, exits, messages, and command input. It also handles user interactions through buttons and text fields.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. **UI Layout Management**: Organizes the game interface into sections (top, middle, bottom) using `BorderLayout` and `GridLayout`.
2. **Dynamic Content Display**: Displays room descriptions, items, exits, and messages dynamically based on the game state.
3. **User Interaction**: Provides buttons and a text field for user input (e.g., commands, map, shelter selection).
4. **Game State Integration**: Integrates with `GameEngine` to fetch and display game data.
5. **Custom UI Components**: Creates custom panels and labels for displaying game information.

### **Instance Variables**
- **`private static final long serialVersionUID`**: Unique identifier for serialization.
- **`Color background`**: The background color of the panel.
- **`GameEngine game`**: The game engine providing game state data.
- **`GameFrame frame`**: The parent frame containing the panel.
- **`JTextField commandField`**: The text field for entering commands.

### **Constructor**
- **`GamePanel(GameEngine game, GameFrame frame)`**
  - Initializes the panel with the game engine and parent frame.
  - Calls the `add` method to set up the UI components.

### **Methods**
1. **`add(GameEngine game)`**
   - Sets up the UI layout and adds components to the panel.
   - Divides the panel into three sections: top (status), middle (room details), and bottom (commands).
   - Dynamically generates content based on the game state.

2. **`setCommandField()`**
   - Sets focus on the command input field.

3. **`addButton(JPanel panel, String buttonName, ActionListener action, int size)`**
   - Creates a button with the specified name and action listener and adds it to the panel.

4. **`addPanel(JPanel panel)`**
   - Adds a custom panel to the main panel.

5. **`CreateStatusPanel(GameEngine game)`**
   - Creates and returns a panel displaying the player's status and time.

6. **`CreatePanel(int flowType)`**
   - Creates and returns a panel with a specified layout (centered or left-aligned).

7. **`CreateLabelPanel(String labelString, int flowType)`**
   - Creates and returns a panel containing a label with the specified text.

8. **`getLineLength(String line)`**
   - Calculates the appropriate line length for wrapping text based on the game's line length constant.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**

#### **1. Tight Coupling with `GameEngine`**
- **Flaw**: The class is tightly coupled with `GameEngine`, making it difficult to reuse or test.
- **Change**: Use an interface or abstract class to decouple the panel from the game engine.

#### **2. Hardcoded Layout Logic**
- **Flaw**: The layout logic is hardcoded, making it inflexible for different screen sizes or UI themes.
- **Change**: Use a layout manager or configuration file to manage the UI layout dynamically.

#### **3. Lack of Error Handling**
- **Flaw**: The class does not handle potential errors (e.g., invalid game state or missing components).
- **Change**: Add error handling to ensure the UI fails gracefully.

#### **4. Inefficient String Manipulation**
- **Flaw**: The `getLineLength` method uses inefficient string manipulation for text wrapping.
- **Change**: Use a `StringBuilder` or dedicated text wrapping utility for better performance.

#### **5. Magic Numbers**
- **Flaw**: The class uses magic numbers (e.g., `flowType == 1`), making the code harder to understand.
- **Change**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

#### **6. Limited Scalability**
- **Flaw**: The class assumes a fixed structure for the UI, which limits scalability.
- **Change**: Use dynamic data structures (e.g., `List` instead of arrays) to allow for a variable number of UI components.

### **Improved Version of the Class**
Here’s a refactored version of the `GamePanel` class with some of the suggested changes applied:

```java
public class GamePanel extends JPanel {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private Color background;
    private GameEngine game;
    private GameFrame frame;
    private JTextField commandField;

    public GamePanel(GameEngine game, GameFrame frame) {
        this.game = game;
        this.frame = frame;
        initializeUI();
    }

    private void initializeUI() {
        // Set layout and background
        this.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        this.background = this.getBackground();

        // Top section: Status panel
        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1, 1));
        topPanel.add(createStatusPanel(game));
        topPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(0, 0, 1, 0, Color.black));

        // Middle section: Room details
        JPanel middlePanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(18, 1));
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel(game.getRoom(), 1));
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel("", 1));

        // Add items to the room panel
        String itemString = game.getItems();
        while (itemString.length() > 0) {
            int lineLength = getLineLength(itemString);
            String itemLine = itemString.substring(0, lineLength).trim();
            itemString = itemString.substring(lineLength);
            middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel(itemLine, 1));
        }

        if (game.getItems().length() > 0) {
            middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel("", 1));
        }

        // Add exits and special exits
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel(game.getExits(), 1));
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel(game.getSpecialExits(), 1));
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel("", 2));

        // Display message
        middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel("", 1));
        String[] messages = game.getMessage().split("\\|");
        for (String msg : messages) {
            middlePanel.add(createLabelPanel(msg, 1));
        }

        // Add buttons for hints, shelters, or saved games
        if (game.getGame().checkStart()) {
            JPanel inputPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1, 1));
            addButton(inputPanel, "Click for Clues & Hints", new BookButton(game, this), 260);
            middlePanel.add(inputPanel);
        }

        if (game.getResponseType() == 2) {
            String[] shelters = {"Grandpa's Shack", "Cave of Snelm", "Log Cabin"};
            Integer[] shelterLocations = {44, 11, 41};

### **Summary of Changes**
1. **Improved Encapsulation**: Moved UI initialization logic into a separate method (`initializeUI`).
2. **Error Handling**: Added null checks and error handling for critical components (e.g., `commandField`).
3. **Code Readability**: Improved method and variable names for better readability.
4. **Dynamic Layout**: Used constants and dynamic layout management for better scalability.

### **Additional Suggestions**
1. **UI Themes**: Add support for customizable UI themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
2. **Responsive Design**: Use a responsive layout manager to adapt the UI to different screen sizes.
3. **Logging**: Add logging for debugging and tracking UI events.

## **LightningPanel**

### **Overview**
The `LightningPanel` class is a custom `JPanel` that simulates a lightning effect by alternating the background color between yellow and black. It also displays a label with the text "⚡⚡ Lightning Flashes ⚡⚡" in the center of the panel. After a certain number of iterations, the panel resets and returns to the original `GamePanel`.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Simulate a lightning effect by alternating the background color.
2. Display a label with a lightning-themed message.
3. Reset the panel to its original state after the lightning effect completes.

### **Instance Variables**
- `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`: A version control identifier for serialization.
- `private int number = 0;`: A counter used to control the lightning effect.
- `private JLabel label;`: A label to display the lightning-themed message.
- `private GamePanel game;`: A reference to the `GamePanel` to which this panel belongs.
- `private GameEngine engine;`: A reference to the `GameEngine` used to reset the panel.

### **Constructor**
- `public LightningPanel(int initialNumber, GamePanel game, GameEngine engine)`:
  - Initializes the `LightningPanel` with an initial number, a reference to the `GamePanel`, and a reference to the `GameEngine`.
  - Sets the layout to `BorderLayout` to center the label.
  - Creates and configures the `JLabel` with a custom font and text color.
  - Starts the lightning effect by calling `startLightningEffect()`.

### **Methods**
1. **`private void startLightningEffect()`**:
   - Starts a `Timer` that alternates the background color between yellow and black every 200 milliseconds.
   - Increments the `number` counter with each iteration.
   - Stops the timer after 10 iterations and resets the panel by calling `resetPanel(game)`.
   - Adds a new `JLabel` with the text "Lightning Flashes!!" during each iteration.
   - Repaints the panel to reflect changes.

2. **`private void resetPanel(GamePanel game)`**:
   - Resets the `GamePanel` by removing all components and adding the `GameEngine` back to it.
   - Calls `revalidate()` and `repaint()` to update the UI.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**
1. **Memory Leak from Repeated Label Addition**:
   - In the `startLightningEffect()` method, a new `JLabel` is created and added to the panel during each iteration. This can lead to a memory leak as the old labels are not removed.
   - **Fix**: Remove the line `this.add(label);` or clear the panel before adding a new label.

2. **Hardcoded Iteration Limit**:
   - The number of iterations (10) is hardcoded, which limits flexibility.
   - **Fix**: Make the iteration limit configurable by adding a parameter to the constructor or method.

3. **Unnecessary Repainting**:
   - The `repaint()` method is called in every iteration, which may cause unnecessary performance overhead.
   - **Fix**: Only call `repaint()` when the background color changes.

4. **Lack of Error Handling**:
   - The class does not handle cases where `game` or `engine` might be `null`.
   - **Fix**: Add null checks in the constructor and methods to prevent `NullPointerException`.

5. **Static Serialization ID**:
   - The `serialVersionUID` is set to `1L`, but serialization is not used in the class. This is unnecessary unless the class is intended for serialization.
   - **Fix**: Remove the `serialVersionUID` if serialization is not required.

6. **Hardcoded Colors and Font**:
   - The colors (yellow, black) and font (Arial, bold, size 36) are hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
   - **Fix**: Make these configurable via constructor parameters or setter methods.

7. **Potential UI Flickering**:
   - Rapid changes in the background color and label addition might cause UI flickering.
   - **Fix**: Use double buffering or optimize the repainting logic.

## **MapPanel**

### **Overview**
The `MapPanel` class is a custom `JPanel` that represents a grid-based map for a game. It displays a 11x10 grid of rooms, each represented by a `JPanel`. The rooms are dynamically configured based on their position, visited status, and exits. Additionally, it includes a button for returning to the game screen.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Display a grid of rooms, each with custom borders and images based on their properties.
2. Handle the display of the player's current location and room types.
3. Add a button to the panel for game-related actions.

### **Instance Variables**
- `private static final long serialVersionUID = -1097043236506747632L;`: A version control identifier for serialization.
- `private GameEngine engine;`: A reference to the `GameEngine` to access game data and logic.
- `private GamePanel game;`: A reference to the `GamePanel` to manage UI transitions.

### **Constructor**
- `public MapPanel(GamePanel game, GameEngine engine)`:
  - Initializes the `MapPanel` with references to the `GamePanel` and `GameEngine`.
  - Sets the layout to a `GridLayout` of size 11x10.
  - Iterates through 110 rooms (1 to 109) and configures each room's appearance based on its position, visited status, and exits.
  - Adds a button to the panel at a specific position (x=85).

### **Methods**
1. **`private void addButton(JPanel panel, String buttonName, ActionListener action)`**:
   - Creates a button with the specified name and adds it to the given panel.
   - Configures the button's action listener to handle click events.
   - Sets an empty border around the button for spacing.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**
1. **Hardcoded Grid Size**:
   - The grid size (11x10) and the number of rooms (110) are hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
   - **Fix**: Make the grid size configurable via constructor parameters or configuration files.

2. **Inefficient Room Border Logic**:
   - The logic for setting room borders is repetitive and hardcoded, making it difficult to maintain or modify.
   - **Fix**: Use a more modular approach, such as a helper method or a configuration map, to determine border styles based on room position.

3. **Image Loading Errors**:
   - The image loading logic does not handle missing or invalid images gracefully, potentially causing runtime errors.
   - **Fix**: Add error handling for missing images and provide a default image or placeholder.

4. **Hardcoded Button Position**:
   - The button is added at a hardcoded position (x=85), which may not be intuitive or flexible.
   - **Fix**: Make the button position configurable or dynamically determine its placement.

5. **Lack of Encapsulation**:
   - The `GameEngine` and `GamePanel` references are directly accessed and manipulated, which can lead to tight coupling.
   - **Fix**: Use interfaces or dependency injection to decouple the `MapPanel` from specific implementations of `GameEngine` and `GamePanel`.

6. **Performance Issues**:
   - Loading and scaling images for each room during initialization can be slow, especially for larger grids.
   - **Fix**: Preload and cache images to improve performance.

7. **Static Serialization ID**:
   - The `serialVersionUID` is set, but serialization is not used in the class. This is unnecessary unless the class is intended for serialization.
   - **Fix**: Remove the `serialVersionUID` if serialization is not required.

8. **Magic Numbers**:
   - The code contains many magic numbers (e.g., `x==85`, `x==71`, `x==80`), which reduce readability and maintainability.
   - **Fix**: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

9. **UI Scaling Issues**:
   - The image size (50x50) and button border spacing (320) are hardcoded, which may not scale well on different screen sizes.
   - **Fix**: Use dynamic sizing based on the screen resolution or user preferences.

10. **Lack of Documentation**:
    - The code lacks comments or documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain logic.
    - **Fix**: Add comments to explain complex logic, especially for border configuration and image loading.

## **MessagePanel**

### **Overview**
The `MessagePanel` class is a custom `JPanel` designed to display messages in a game. It supports displaying multiple messages sequentially, with a delay between each message. After displaying all messages, it resets the panel to the original `GameEngine` view.

### **Key Responsibilities**
1. Display a primary message and optionally split and display a secondary message.
2. Handle sequential message display with configurable delays.
3. Reset the panel to the original `GameEngine` view after all messages are displayed.

### **Instance Variables**
- `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`: A version control identifier for serialization.
- `private JLabel label;`: A label to display the message.
- `private GamePanel game;`: A reference to the `GamePanel` to manage UI transitions.
- `private GameEngine engine;`: A reference to the `GameEngine` to reset the panel.

### **Constructor**
- `public MessagePanel(GamePanel game, GameEngine engine, String messageOne, String messageTwo, int noMessages)`:
  - Initializes the `MessagePanel` with references to the `GamePanel` and `GameEngine`.
  - Sets the layout to `BorderLayout` to center the label.
  - Displays the first message (`messageOne`) in a `JLabel`.
  - Splits the second message (`messageTwo`) using the `|` delimiter and starts a sequence to display messages with delays.

### **Methods**
1. **`private JLabel createLabel(String text)`**:
   - Creates and configures a `JLabel` with the specified text, centered alignment, and a custom font.
   - Returns the configured `JLabel`.

2. **`private void startSequence(int noMessages, String messageOne, String messageTwo)`**:
   - Starts a new thread to handle the sequential display of messages.
   - Introduces a delay (2 seconds by default, or 5 seconds if `noMessages` is 0).
   - After the delay, either resets the panel to the `GameEngine` view or creates a new `MessagePanel` to display the next message.

3. **`private void setPanel(JPanel game, JPanel panel)`**:
   - Replaces the current panel in the `GamePanel` with the specified panel.
   - Calls `revalidate()` and `repaint()` to update the UI.

4. **`private void resetPanel(GamePanel game)`**:
   - Resets the `GamePanel` to the original `GameEngine` view.
   - Calls `revalidate()` and `repaint()` to update the UI.

### **Potential Flaws and Possible Changes**
1. **Hardcoded Delays**:
   - The delays (2 seconds and 5 seconds) are hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
   - **Fix**: Make the delays configurable via constructor parameters or configuration files.

2. **Thread Management**:
   - The `startSequence` method creates a new thread for each message, which can lead to resource exhaustion if many messages are displayed.
   - **Fix**: Use a single-threaded scheduler (e.g., `ScheduledExecutorService`) to manage delays more efficiently.

3. **String Manipulation Complexity**:
   - The logic for splitting and concatenating messages (`messageOne` and `messageTwo`) is complex and error-prone.
   - **Fix**: Simplify the logic or use a list of messages to handle sequential display more cleanly.

4. **Lack of Error Handling**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `messageTwo` might be `null` or empty, which could cause issues during splitting.
   - **Fix**: Add null checks and handle edge cases gracefully.

5. **Static Serialization ID**:
   - The `serialVersionUID` is set, but serialization is not used in the class. This is unnecessary unless the class is intended for serialization.
   - **Fix**: Remove the `serialVersionUID` if serialization is not required.

6. **Hardcoded Font and Alignment**:
   - The font (Arial, bold, size 24) and alignment (center) are hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
   - **Fix**: Make these configurable via constructor parameters or setter methods.

7. **UI Update Logic**:
   - The `setPanel` and `resetPanel` methods directly manipulate the `GamePanel`, which can lead to tight coupling.
   - **Fix**: Use an interface or callback mechanism to decouple the `MessagePanel` from the `GamePanel`.

8. **Potential Memory Leaks**:
   - Each `MessagePanel` instance creates a new thread, which might not be properly cleaned up if the panel is removed or replaced.
   - **Fix**: Ensure threads are properly terminated or use a managed threading approach.

9. **Lack of Documentation**:
   - The code lacks comments or documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain logic.
   - **Fix**: Add comments to explain complex logic, especially for message splitting and thread handling.

10. **Hardcoded Delimiter**:
    - The delimiter (`|`) for splitting `messageTwo` is hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
    - **Fix**: Make the delimiter configurable via constructor parameters or configuration files.
