# Island of Secrets

This project is a modern translation of the game *Island of Secrets*, originally published as a BASIC listing in a book of the same name. Players would type the game into their computers to play it. However, the authors intentionally obfuscated the code to make it difficult for users to deduce the game’s solution, while still leaving the game playable. 

This approach came with challenges: errors often crept in during transcription, and the lack of comments or documentation made it hard for users to learn the tricks of the BASIC language. The code’s readability was also notoriously poor, adding to the difficulty.

- [Read the book on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/island-of-secrets_202303)  
- [View the original BASIC version on GitHub](https://github.com/s3664099/basic_scripts/tree/master/Island%20of%20Secrets)

- Redo the classes using the same style as Command Process 

## Notes on the Basic Code

### Reading the Data
Unlike many other games, this program doesn't load all data into memory at once, likely due to memory constraints of early computers. Instead, it reads one item at a time, which slows down the game as data must be read repeatedly.  

- **Line 2780**: Repositions the pointer to the beginning of the data and iterates through all locations, discarding each one.  
- **Line 4110**: Iterates through and discards all objects.

Object locations are stored in a string `H$`, where ASCII symbols represent specific locations. The next line uses the string `Q$` as a flag for each object, influencing gameplay throughout.

The game operates on a 10x10 grid, with movement between nodes determined by:
- Adding or subtracting **1** (east or west movement)
- Adding or subtracting **10** (north or south movement)

### Documentation
A supplementary file contains detailed notes on:
- The BASIC code sections and their functions
- Variables, items, locations, verbs, and nouns

## Executing the Game
To compile and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Start
   ```

## Development Notes ##

### Version 1 (v01)
- **Status**: The game works but has some issues. 
- **Goals**:
  - Upgrade the game for better readability.
  - Transition from a command-line interface to a windowed environment for smoother gameplay.
  - Refine and organize the notes file.

**2 November 2024**:  
- Completed initialization classes.
- Segregated locations and objects into dedicated methods within the game class.  
- Adopted full words for commands instead of truncating to the first three letters, a practice originally used for simplicity on older systems. Commands are stored in immutable arrays.

### Version 2 (v02)
- **Status**: Transitioned to a Swing-based UI.  
- **Challenges**:
  - Styling issues need resolution.
  - Extensive testing required to ensure functionality.
  - Aim to reuse the structure for future similar games.

**29 December 2024**:  
- Added a dedicated testing class:
  - Allows setting variables before the game starts.
  - Includes methods to output details to the console for debugging.

**30 December 2024**:  
- Enhanced store room descriptions to include a door to the east and a trapdoor.  
- Added detailed descriptions for special directions, improving clarity compared to earlier iterations where these were missing.

**5 March 2025**
- Completed v4 (as listed below). Redoing the program structure by having ChatGPT write and and provide recommendations for changing the code.

### Version 3 (v03)
- **Status**: Completed testing and are able to complete Game without errors or changing any variables.
- **Challenges**:
  - Numerous Issues with regards to being able to solve the game without help or knowing the code
  - Styling of command input and button need to be fixed
  - Errors produced when save game using more than one word

### Version 4 (v04)
- **Status**: Completed Game
- **Additions**:
  - Map screen added that user can toggle between main game and map
  - Image folder added to hold images for the map
  - Linked images to locations
  - Added buttons to repeat previous commands (Last three)
  - Made it possible to execute give and shelter in single command
  - Added buttons for loading saved games and removed display command
  - Added a restart game button
  - Added extra sections to examine so book isn't relied upon
  - Added link to open up book in Internet Archive
