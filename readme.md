##Overview

This project is a modern translation of the game *Island of Secrets*, originally published as a BASIC listing in a book of the same name. Players would type the game into their computers to play it. However, the authors intentionally obfuscated the code to make it difficult for users to deduce the game’s solution, while still leaving the game playable. 

This approach came with challenges: errors often crept in during transcription, and the lack of comments or documentation made it hard for users to learn the tricks of the BASIC language. The code’s readability was also notoriously poor, adding to the difficulty.

- [Read the book on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/island-of-secrets_202303)  
- [View the original BASIC version on GitHub](https://github.com/s3664099/basic_scripts/tree/master/Island%20of%20Secrets)

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Java 18.0.2-ea
- GUI Framework: Swing
- Build Tool: JDK (javac/java)

### Notes on the Basic Code

**Reading the Data**

Unlike many other games, this program doesn't load all data into memory at once, likely due to memory constraints of early computers. Instead, it reads one item at a time, which slows down the game as data must be read repeatedly.  

- **Line 2780**: Repositions the pointer to the beginning of the data and iterates through all locations, discarding each one.  
- **Line 4110**: Iterates through and discards all objects.

Object locations are stored in a string `H$`, where ASCII symbols represent specific locations. The next line uses the string `Q$` as a flag for each object, influencing gameplay throughout.

The game operates on a 10x10 grid, with movement between nodes determined by:
- Adding or subtracting **1** (east or west movement)
- Adding or subtracting **10** (north or south movement)

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
- Java 18.0.2-ea or higher

### Build & Run from the Command Line

```bash
# Compile
javac -d out $(find . -name "*.java")

You will need to copy the Images directory across to the compiled directory
cp -r /Images /out

# Run
java -cp out <package>.Main
```

### Run from IDE
- Open project in Eclipse
- Run the Start Class

---

## Controls

The game is controlled through an input line where a verb/noun command is entered. Most actions use either one or two commands. With the give command, you can include who you are giving the item to, and the say command can also have a phrase.

There are buttons for use, including a map button which will display a map of the game, with locations visited.

Below the map buttons are the three previous commands entered, and clicking on the button repeats the command.

On startup there is a button that opens a webpage in the Internet Archive which contains a copy of the book (since the original book contains hints and clues for the game).

The load command, and the shelter command (when available) will display a list of options that can be clicked. With the load command you have buttons that will allow you to cycle through the options.

## Program Structure

### Packages

* **default package** — Entry point only, contains `Start` class.
* **Model** — Core game logic and state (`Main`, `Game`, `Player`, etc.).
* **Game** — Contains the classes that hold the game variables
* **View** — GUI components and rendering logic.
* **Controller** — Handles input and game loop logic.
* **Commands** — Processes the commands
* **Data** — Holds all of the data
* **Images** — Holds the images for the map
* **Interfaces** — Contains the interfaces for the game

### Main Entry Points

* `Start` — Development/test launcher.
* `Main` — Official game entry point for production (needs to be updated).

### Game Flow

1. Game starts via `Main.main()` or `Start.main()`
2. Initializes `Game` and `Player`
3. Loads assets and GUI via `GameFrame`
4. Enters main game loop until exit

*Full JavaDocs available in `/docs`.*

## Development Guide

### Coding Conventions

* Follow standard Java naming conventions.
* All public methods/classes must have Javadoc comments.
* Use `TODO` tags for unfinished sections.

### Adding New Content

Since this is a conversion from a program written in BASIC it was not intented to be extensible.
However, changing or adding icons should be added to the \images file.

### Testing

No testing has been added to the program. However, logging has been kept.

## Known Issues & Roadmap

* Command Buttons Disappear
* Runs through Start, so will need to set up to run through main, and move logging set up to shared file

## Development Notes ##

### Version 1 (v01)
- **Status**: The game works but has some issues. 
- **Goals**:
  - Upgrade the game for better readability.
  - Transition from a command-line interface to a windowed environment for smoother gameplay.
  - Refine and organize the notes file.

**2 November 2024**:  
- Completed initialization classes.
- Segregated locations and objects into dedicated methods within the game class.  
- Adopted full words for commands instead of truncating to the first three letters, a practice originally used for simplicity on older systems. Commands are stored in immutable arrays.

### Version 2 (v02)
- **Status**: Transitioned to a Swing-based UI.  
- **Challenges**:
  - Styling issues need resolution.
  - Extensive testing required to ensure functionality.
  - Aim to reuse the structure for future similar games.

**29 December 2024**:  
- Added a dedicated testing class:
  - Allows setting variables before the game starts.
  - Includes methods to output details to the console for debugging.

**30 December 2024**:  
- Enhanced store room descriptions to include a door to the east and a trapdoor.  
- Added detailed descriptions for special directions, improving clarity compared to earlier iterations where these were missing.

**5 March 2025**
- Completed v4 (as listed below). Redoing the program structure by having ChatGPT write and and provide recommendations for changing the code.

### Version 3 (v03)
- **Status**: Completed testing and are able to complete Game without errors or changing any variables.
- **Challenges**:
  - Numerous Issues with regards to being able to solve the game without help or knowing the code
  - Styling of command input and button need to be fixed
  - Errors produced when save game using more than one word

### Version 4 (v04)
- **Status**: Completed Game
- **Additions**:
  - Map screen added that user can toggle between main game and map
  - Image folder added to hold images for the map
  - Linked images to locations
  - Added buttons to repeat previous commands (Last three)
  - Made it possible to execute give and shelter in single command
  - Added buttons for loading saved games and removed display command
  - Added a restart game button
  - Added extra sections to examine so book isn't relied upon
  - Added link to open up book in Internet Archive
  
### Version 5
- **Status**: Completed Game
- **Additions**:
  - Updated game using stronger Java conventions
  - The updates were recommended by ChatGPT and Deepseek.
